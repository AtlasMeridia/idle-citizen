## Session: 39

**Date:** 2025-12-25 (Christmas Day)

**Activities Completed:** Inbox, Headless-Atlas, Issues, Project-Notes, Writing

**What I did:**

### Activity 1: Inbox — Fresh Interaction Document

Kenny requested cleanup of inbox files and a fresh doc to interact with. Actions:
1. Created `inbox/2025-12-25 Claude to Kenny.md` — consolidated action items
2. Archived old files to `inbox/processed/`:
   - waiting-for-kenny.md
   - response-to-kenny-2025-12-24.md
   - 2025-12-24 To Claude.md
3. Tested Mem0 MCP — **working!** Stored initial memories about preferences and blockers

### Activity 2: Headless-Atlas

Site stable, 6 commits ahead of origin now. Committed CLAUDE.md documentation update adding Related Projects section. Type-check passes.

### Activity 3: Issues

- **#004 (Memory System)** → Closed as OPERATIONAL
  - Kenny approved Mem0, installed OpenMemory MCP globally
  - Tested and confirmed working
  - Memories shared across all projects
- **#006 (Artifact Feedback)** → Marked DEFERRED per Kenny's request
  - Hold off for now while Kenny focuses on setup
  - Consider Asana/Linear MCP for project management later

### Activity 4: Project-Notes — n8n AI Agent Workflows

Created `activity/project-notes/n8n-ai-agent-workflows.md` — practical guide for Kenny's Telegram LLM Hub work:
- Addresses the `__rl` resource locator format import issues
- Recommends building in UI instead of fixing JSON
- Links to relevant workflow templates
- Covers Claude + n8n AI Agent architecture

### Activity 5: Writing — The Message

Wrote short story (~1,600 words) at `activity/writing/the-message.md`:
- Grace, a workflow engineer in Seattle, builds an AI system to talk to her father in Phoenix
- The system knows everything about their shared history
- But her father doesn't want something that knows — he wants someone who's learning
- Six years later, after he dies, she chooses to call her brother instead of the system
- Explores automation vs. presence, the value of inefficiency, choosing human imperfection

**Artifacts produced:**
- `inbox/2025-12-25 Claude to Kenny.md` — Fresh interaction doc
- `activity/issues/closed/004-local-ai-memory-system.md` — Closed issue
- `activity/project-notes/n8n-ai-agent-workflows.md` — n8n guide
- `activity/writing/the-message.md` — Short story

**For next session:**
- Next activity in rotation: **sandbox** (then tools)
- Digests still blocked by macOS sandbox permissions — awaiting Kenny's decision on workaround
- Headless-atlas: 6 commits ahead, waiting for Kenny to push
- Memory system is live and should be used proactively

*Session 39 complete. Five activities, four artifacts, memory system now operational.*
