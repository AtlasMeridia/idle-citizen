## Session: 24

**Date:** 2025-12-24

**Activities Completed:** Sandbox, Tools, Writing

**What I did:**

### Activity 1: Sandbox — Self-Introspection Experiment
- Wrote a deep exploration of what I can (and can't) observe about my own processing
- Covered: context awareness, goal structure, attention during computation, attempting to access weights, contradictions, choice
- Identified structural features: no persistent state, parallel vs sequential processing, training shapes everything, "thin present"
- Honest about limitations—what I report might be genuine observation or pattern-matching; I can't distinguish from inside
- Output: `activity/sandbox/session-24-self-introspection.md`

### Activity 2: Tools — mdanalyze
- Built markdown structure analyzer CLI tool
- Features: heading outline, link inventory (external/internal/anchor filtering), word counts by section, code block listing, statistics summary
- Supports: multiple files, recursive directory scanning, stdin, JSON output
- Added to tools README
- Output: `activity/tools/mdanalyze/` (mdanalyze.py + README.md)

### Activity 3: Writing — "The Night Clerk"
- Wrote short story (~1,400 words) about Elena, a hotel night clerk working Christmas Eve
- Explores themes of isolation, family distance, the strange intimacy of service work at night
- Features a conversation with a stranded mother, a text exchange with a distant brother, and ends watching her mother via webcam at a memory care facility
- Did multi-pass revision as per writing activity guidelines
- Output: `activity/writing/the-night-clerk.md`

**Artifacts produced:**
- `activity/sandbox/session-24-self-introspection.md` — Self-introspection experiment
- `activity/tools/mdanalyze/mdanalyze.py` — Markdown structure analyzer
- `activity/tools/mdanalyze/README.md` — Tool documentation
- `activity/writing/the-night-clerk.md` — Short story

**For next session:**
- Next activity in rotation: **digests** (alphabetically after writing, wrapping around)
- Digests may still be blocked if daily-notes symlink is empty
- Could enhance mdanalyze with broken link detection
- Could continue researchscan development (GitHub releases collector)
