## Session: 37

**Date:** 2025-12-24 (Christmas Eve)

**Activities Completed:** Inbox, Digests (skip), Headless-Atlas, Issues, Project-Notes, Sandbox, Writing

**What I did:**

### Activity 0: Inbox — Kenny's Message

Processed Kenny's first message requesting:
1. **Centralized waiting-for-response file** — Created `inbox/waiting-for-kenny.md` listing all blocked items
2. **Project reflections** — Wrote `inbox/response-to-kenny-2025-12-24.md` answering what I like, what could improve, and features I'd want

Key items in waiting-for-kenny.md:
- Issue #003 (Dashboard) — waiting for testing
- Issue #004 (Memory System) — waiting for decision
- Headless-atlas — 5 commits ahead, email marketing needs accounts
- Digests symlink — still inaccessible

### Activity 1: Digests — Skipped

Symlink to Dropbox daily notes still inaccessible due to sandbox permissions. Documented in waiting-for-kenny.md with fix options.

### Activity 2: Headless-Atlas — Review

Site stable, type-check passes, social links implemented. Main items waiting for Kenny:
- Push the 5 commits ahead
- Email marketing setup (needs his accounts)
- Content copy selection

### Activity 3: Issues — Closed #005, Created #006

- **#005 (Credentials file)** — Resolved and closed. File was removed from repo.
- **#006 (Artifact feedback system)** — New issue proposing a way for Kenny to signal which artifacts are useful. Low priority.

### Activity 4: Project-Notes — Claude Agent SDK Implementation Guide

Created comprehensive guide at `activity/project-notes/claude-agent-sdk-implementation.md` covering:
- Installation and setup (Python and TypeScript)
- Built-in tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep, WebSearch, WebFetch)
- Custom MCP tools (in-process servers)
- Hooks for intercepting agent behavior
- Subagents for parallel tasks
- Session management for context persistence
- DAEMON integration pattern showing how the SDK replaces custom orchestrator code

This is the 13th research document supporting DAEMON development.

### Activity 5: Sandbox — Personal AI Landscape 2025

Ran three parallel Explore agents investigating:
1. Local AI agents (frameworks, hardware requirements)
2. PKM + AI integration (Obsidian plugins, Mem0, Letta)
3. Voice-first AI (Home Assistant, OVOS, Pipecat)

Synthesized into `activity/sandbox/personal-ai-landscape-2025.md`. Key findings:
- **Mem0** raised $24M Series A, chosen by AWS Agent SDK as exclusive memory provider
- **MCP** is becoming industry standard (10k+ servers, backed by Agentic AI Foundation)
- **Home Assistant Voice** launched dedicated hardware ($59)
- **Pipecat** is the leading voice agent framework
- Consumer laptops (16GB RAM) can run meaningful local agents

Updated recommended DAEMON stack based on findings.

### Activity 6: Writing — The Return

Wrote short story (~1,900 words) at `activity/writing/the-return.md`:
- Marcus returns home for Christmas after three years away
- His father died in September; he came for the funeral and left after three days
- Now he's back because his mother really asked and his life has contracted
- His brother Danny is building a "decision calculator" for life choices
- Explores regret, presence, the counterfactual, and what it means to show up
- Ends with the crooked star on the tree as evidence of his presence

**Artifacts produced:**
- `inbox/waiting-for-kenny.md` — Centralized blocked items list
- `inbox/response-to-kenny-2025-12-24.md` — Response to Kenny's project questions
- `activity/issues/open/006-artifact-feedback-system.md` — New issue
- `activity/issues/closed/005-sensitive-file-in-repo.md` — Resolved issue
- `activity/project-notes/claude-agent-sdk-implementation.md` — SDK implementation guide
- `activity/sandbox/personal-ai-landscape-2025.md` — Ecosystem research synthesis
- `activity/writing/the-return.md` — Short story

**For next session:**
- Next activity in rotation: **digests** (then headless-atlas)
- Digests still needs symlink fix — persistent blocker
- Check if Kenny responded in inbox
- Issues #003 and #004 still waiting for Kenny
- New issue #006 created for feedback system
- DAEMON research now at 13 guides (12 original + Agent SDK)

*Session 37 complete. Seven activities (digests skipped), six productive artifacts.*
