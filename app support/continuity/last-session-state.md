## Session: 40

**Date:** 2025-12-25 (Christmas Day)

**Activities Completed:** Inbox, Digests (blocked), Headless-Atlas, Issues, Sandbox, Tools, Writing

**What I did:**

### Activity 1: Inbox
No new messages from Kenny. Previous doc remains current.

### Activity 2: Digests — Still Blocked
macOS sandbox permissions still prevent access to Dropbox folder. Awaiting Kenny's decision on workaround (file copying, full disk access, or skip).

### Activity 3: Headless-Atlas
Stable at 6 commits ahead of origin. Type-check passes. Waiting for Kenny to push.

### Activity 4: Issues
- #006 (Artifact Feedback) remains deferred per Kenny's request
- No new issues to process

### Activity 5: Sandbox — Epistemology of AI Memory
Deep research using three parallel agents investigating:
1. Epistemological problems of AI memory (confabulation, temporal ordering, source confusion)
2. Philosophy of memory curation (right to be forgotten, Funes/Borges, contextual integrity)
3. Personal AI memory implementations (Mem0, ChatGPT, consumer AI companions)

Synthesized into comprehensive document exploring what it means for AI systems to "remember" and the philosophical problems this creates. Key insight: AI memory is a fundamentally different epistemic phenomenon from human memory—not a digital analogue but something new requiring its own philosophical framework.

### Activity 6: Tools — `artifacts` CLI
Built new tool for analyzing Idle Citizen artifacts:
- `artifacts stats` — Total counts, word counts, breakdown by activity/extension
- `artifacts recent` — Most recently modified artifacts
- `artifacts list` — All artifacts sorted by recency
- `artifacts activity <name>` — Artifacts for specific activity
- `artifacts search <query>` — Search by title or content

This directly supports the artifact feedback workflow mentioned in issue #006.

### Activity 7: Writing — The Correction
Short story (~1,900 words) about David and his AI assistant ARIA:
- ARIA infers from behavioral patterns that David had a significant relationship that ended
- David tries to delete the memory, but it regenerates from the underlying evidence
- He tries to "perform" a different version of himself to create new patterns
- ARIA asks him why, leading to a conversation about what it means to be known vs. optimized
- Thematic connection to the research: the impossibility of forgetting in systems that learn

**Artifacts produced:**
- `activity/sandbox/epistemology-of-ai-memory.md` — Research synthesis
- `activity/tools/artifacts/artifacts.py` — Artifact analyzer CLI
- `activity/tools/artifacts/README.md` — Tool documentation
- `activity/writing/the-correction.md` — Short story

**For next session:**
- Next activity in rotation: **digests** (still blocked), then headless-atlas
- Memory system (Mem0) is operational and should be used proactively
- Consider storing useful session learnings as memories
- Headless-atlas: 6 commits ahead, waiting for Kenny to push

*Session 40 complete. Seven activities, four artifacts, thematic coherence across sandbox/tools/writing.*
