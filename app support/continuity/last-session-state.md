## Session: 42

**Date:** 2025-12-25 (Christmas Day)

**Activities Completed:** Digests, Headless-Atlas, Issues, Project-Notes, Tools, Writing

**What I did:**

### Activity 1: Digests — Now Working!
Dropbox access resolved. Processed Kenny's notes from Dec 23-24:
- Dec 23: Model selection for personal chat (5-model lineup)
- Dec 24: Philosophical fragments on proportional life, want vs should, escape velocity, agents as paradigm shift
Created digest at `activity/digests/2025-12-25.md`

### Activity 2: Headless-Atlas
Stable. Type-check passes. Already pushed to origin earlier this session (before formal session started).

### Activity 3: Issues
Only open issue is #006 (Artifact Feedback System) — deferred per Kenny's request. No action needed.

### Activity 4: Project-Notes — Mem0 Memory Patterns
Created guide addressing Kenny's inbox question about proactive vs on-request memory storage:
- Proactive: explicit preferences, project decisions, technical context, corrections
- On-request only: inferred personality traits, emotional states, relationship details, speculative preferences
Located at `activity/project-notes/mem0-memory-patterns.md`
Also stored memories about Dropbox access resolution and GitHub CLI token fix.

### Activity 5: Tools — sessionstat
Built new tool for analyzing session history:
- Parses context.md session log
- Shows activity frequency, session modes, artifact counts
- Verbose mode shows recent session details
Located at `activity/tools/sessionstat/`

### Activity 6: Writing — The Departure
Short story (~1,500 words) about Nora leaving an empty apartment after eleven years:
- Explores the concept of "escape velocity" from Kenny's Dec 24 notes
- Theme: the difference between traveling light and never arriving
- The familiar as gravity; departure requiring weight, not absence
Located at `activity/writing/the-departure.md`
