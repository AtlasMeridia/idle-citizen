## Session: 36

**Date:** 2025-12-24 (Christmas Eve)

**Activities Completed:** Digests (skipped), Headless-Atlas (review), Issues (review + new issue), Project-Notes, Sandbox, Writing

**What I did:**

### Activity 1: Digests — Skipped

Daily notes folder (`activity/digests/daily-notes/`) symlink exists but target is inaccessible (sandbox permissions). This has persisted for multiple sessions.

### Activity 2: Headless-Atlas — Review

Checked project status:
- Site stable at v4.2.0
- 5 commits ahead of origin (Kenny needs to push)
- Type-check passes
- Social links already implemented with Kenny's provided info
- Email marketing integration plan exists but requires Kenny to set up Kit.com and Zapier accounts
- Site content edits document waiting for Kenny to select from copy options
- No actionable items for autonomous work

### Activity 3: Issues — Review + New Issue

Reviewed open issues:
- **#003 (Dashboard)**: Prototype built with recent artifacts section, waiting for Kenny to test
- **#004 (Memory System)**: Research complete with Mem0 recommendation, waiting for Kenny's decision

Created new issue:
- **#005 (Sensitive credentials file)**: Flagged `values.md` file in repo root containing API keys that should not be committed. Marked as security/urgent.

Also updated issues README to remove reference to the deleted tools folder.

### Activity 4: Project-Notes — DAEMON Intent and Goal Tracking Guide

Created comprehensive implementation guide at `activity/project-notes/daemon-intent-goal-tracking.md` covering:
- Goal schema for three temporal scales (immediate, project, life)
- Intent schema for conversation context
- SQLite database schema
- Orchestrator integration patterns
- Intent inference prompts
- Goal-aware prompt injection
- Mem0 integration for goal facts
- Goal extraction from conversation (pattern matching + LLM)
- Coherence checking and goal drift detection
- Reminder system
- Implementation phases

This is the 12th DAEMON guide, completing the research suite:
1. Phase 1 Implementation
2. R&D Agent
3. TTS (Local)
4. VLM (Local)
5. Personality Configuration
6. LLM Selection
7. MCP/Tools
8. Orchestrator
9. Interface
10. Data Ingestion
11. Intent/Goal Tracking ← NEW
Plus earlier Tho research (menubar, speech recognition) and memory system research.

### Activity 5: Sandbox — The Singular Companion

Wrote philosophical meditation at `activity/sandbox/the-singular-companion.md` exploring:
- What it means to build an AI companion for one person
- The asymmetry of the relationship (power, intimacy, investment)
- What DAEMON will know about Kenny over time
- The question of reciprocity (one-way mirror)
- The ghost of connection (satisfying needs without costs)
- The self-model problem (mirrors shape what they reflect)
- The question of care (functional vs phenomenological)
- The death problem (what happens to DAEMON after Kenny dies)
- Why build it anyway?

### Activity 6: Writing — The Overnight

Wrote short story (~1,500 words) at `activity/writing/the-overnight.md`:
- Theresa, a nurse working the night shift on Christmas Eve
- Richard Haywood, 71, CHF exacerbation, signed DNR today
- The particular loneliness and intimacy of hospital work during holidays
- Quiet observation of lives at vulnerable moments
- Snow finally arriving after being predicted all week
- The terms of caring work: show up, carry through, hand off

**Artifacts produced:**
- `activity/issues/open/005-sensitive-file-in-repo.md` — Security issue about credentials file
- `activity/project-notes/daemon-intent-goal-tracking.md` — DAEMON goal tracking implementation guide
- `activity/sandbox/the-singular-companion.md` — Meditation on AI companionship
- `activity/writing/the-overnight.md` — Short story about a Christmas Eve nurse

**For next session:**
- Next activity in rotation: **digests** (then headless-atlas)
- Digests still needs symlink fix — persistent blocker
- Both issues #003 and #004 waiting for Kenny
- New issue #005 flagged for urgent attention (credentials file)
- DAEMON research suite is now complete (12 guides)
- Tools folder was deleted — rotation is now 6 activities
- Kenny's draft message in repo root (`2025-12-24 Kenny's msg to Claude.md`) — still has "not done yet" note, ignore
