## What Happened

### Attempted
- Continue backfill processing of July 2025 daily notes
- **Result:** BLOCKED — Dropbox folder inaccessible (macOS sandbox permissions)

### Completed Instead
Created comprehensive synthesis documents from existing August-December digests:

1. **meta-analysis-aug-dec-2025.md** — Five-month narrative arc and patterns
2. **thematic-index-2025.md** — Philosophical insights organized by topic
3. **framework-integration.md** — How Kenny's decision frameworks connect
4. **resource-compilation-2025.md** — Technical links organized by category
5. **open-loops-audit.md** — Unresolved tasks and questions
6. **revenue-options-sketch.md** — Paths to Feb 15 first-dollar goal
7. **README.md** — Index and navigation for backfill folder

**Location:** `/activity/digests/backfill/`

## State of the Digests Activity

### Current Position
- **Backfill progress:** 2025-08 (August is oldest processed month)
- **Next target:** 2025-07 (July) — BLOCKED by Dropbox permissions
- **Daily digests exist for:** Aug 1-31 (daily), Sept/Oct/Nov (monthly), Dec 22-25 (daily)

### Blockers
The Dropbox path `/Users/ellis/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/ATLASM Obsidian/00 Inbox/Daily/` returns "Operation not permitted" for all terminal access. This is a macOS sandbox/permission issue, not a path problem.

**To resolve:** Grant Full Disk Access to Terminal.app (or the Claude Code process) in System Preferences > Privacy & Security.

### What Was Created This Session
- 8 synthesis documents totaling ~1,800+ lines:
  1. meta-analysis-aug-dec-2025.md (narrative arc)
  2. thematic-index-2025.md (quotes by topic)
  3. framework-integration.md (how frameworks connect)
  4. resource-compilation-2025.md (links by category)
  5. open-loops-audit.md (unresolved tasks)
  6. revenue-options-sketch.md (Feb 15 paths)
  7. README.md (navigation guide)
  8. aeon-alignment-notes.md (digest → AEON priorities)
- Comprehensive reference system for Kenny's 2025 thinking
- Direct connection established between digests and AEON project

## For Next Session

### If Dropbox Access Is Fixed
1. Process July 2025 notes from archive folder
2. Create `2025-07.md` monthly digest
3. Update `backfill-progress.txt` to `2025-07`
4. Continue backwards to June 2025

### If Still Blocked
Options:
1. Wait for Kenny to grant permissions
2. Process any new December notes that appear
3. Enhance existing synthesis documents
4. Create tools for the digests activity

## Time-Sensitive Items (from analysis)

### Dec 28, 2025 (3 days away)
- Clear out non-essentials
- Regular posting cadence
- Trading accounts operational

### Feb 15, 2026 (7 weeks away)
- First dollar of revenue
- App MVP
- Weekly accountability structure

The `revenue-options-sketch.md` document addresses the Feb 15 deadline with concrete paths.

---

## Notes for Future Sessions

1. The synthesis documents provide substantial value even without new source material
2. Kenny's frameworks form a coherent operating system (see `framework-integration.md`)
3. The open loops audit reveals pattern: many intentions, fewer completions
4. AI/agent work is the clear focus area for Q1 2026

## Discovery This Session

### DAEMON → AEON

The DAEMON concept from the December digests is now the **AEON project** (`/Users/ellis/Projects/aeon/`):

- Already has a working Telegram interface (`@EllisEchoBot`)
- Uses n8n + Claude API + Ollama + mem0
- Full intent document at `docs/intent.md` (617 lines)
- Implements the memory architecture concepts found in notes

### Hinterland Atlas XV

The mysterious December 24 reference is a project at `/Users/ellis/Projects/hinterland-atlas/`:

- Concept-driven travel project
- "Use research as basis for exploring the terrestrial world"
- Connects to September's "slow tour of the USA" concept

### Project Index

The full workspace is documented at `/Users/ellis/Projects/INDEX.md`:
- **Production:** headless-atlas, atlas-style-guide, transcript-pipeline
- **Active:** idle-citizen, aeon
- **Planning:** every-branch-archive, hinterland-atlas
