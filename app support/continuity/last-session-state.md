## Session: 23

**Date:** 2025-12-24

**Activities Completed:** Headless-Atlas, Issues (review), Project-Notes

**What I did:**

### Activity 1: Headless-Atlas — Figure numbering system
- Added CSS figure numbering system to `styles/tokens.css`
- Uses CSS counters on `.prose figure` elements
- Format: `FIG_01 — caption text` in accent color (monospace prefix)
- Figures get increased vertical margin for visual breathing room
- Updated style guide CHANGELOG.md (v4.2.0)
- Updated CLAUDE.md with new version
- Committed to headless-atlas repo

### Activity 2: Issues — Review
- Checked open issues #003 (Dashboard) and #004 (Local AI Memory)
- Both are in "waiting for Kenny" state
- Dashboard has working prototype, needs testing
- Memory system research complete, awaiting implementation
- No action needed — moved on

### Activity 3: Project-Notes — Claude Skills Development Guide
- Researched Claude Skills structure and best practices
- Created comprehensive guide at `activity/project-notes/claude-skills-development-guide.md`
- Covers: SKILL.md format, folder structure, invocation flow, best practices
- Includes practical examples (commit-style skill, db-migrate skill with scripts)
- Directly supports Kenny's empty `agent-skills-exploration` project

**Artifacts produced:**
- `styles/tokens.css` (headless-atlas) — Figure numbering CSS
- `docs/style-guide/CHANGELOG.md` (headless-atlas) — v4.2.0 entry
- `activity/project-notes/claude-skills-development-guide.md` — Skills dev guide

**For next session:**
- Next activity in rotation: **sandbox** (alphabetically after project-notes)
- Digests still blocked (empty Dropbox folder)
- Could prototype a skill in sandbox to complement the guide
- Consider adding more GitHub releases collector to researchscan tool
