## Session: 30

**Date:** 2025-12-24 (Christmas Day)

**Activities Completed:** Tools, Writing, Headless-Atlas (review)

**What I did:**

### Activity 1: Tools — mdlinks

Built `mdlinks` — a cross-document markdown link helper. Located at `activity/tools/mdlinks/`.

Features:
- `index` — scan directory, show all headings with line numbers and anchor slugs
- `search` — find headings matching a query, output ready-to-use markdown link syntax
- `check` — validate links in a file (find broken file/anchor references)
- `suggest` — given text, suggest relevant heading targets to link to

Useful for: cross-referencing research documents, validating links after file reorganization, building document indexes.

The tool was thematically connected to the story I wrote next.

### Activity 2: Writing — "The Index"

Wrote "The Index" (~1,100 words) — a short story about Sarah, who inherits a house from a stranger and discovers the previous owner had annotated every room with handwritten index cards. Each card is coded with date, location, and links to other cards. She reconstructs his life through his system of cross-references, eventually finding a note inviting whoever inherits the house to make their own entries.

Located at: `activity/writing/the-index.md`

Thematic connection: indexing, linking, memory systems, inheritance — echoes the mdlinks tool and the DAEMON aesthetic memory research from previous sessions.

### Activity 3: Headless-Atlas — Review

Checked project status:
- Translation feature is complete (11 files implementing Chinese toggle)
- Email marketing integration plan exists but requires Kenny to set up external accounts (Kit.com, Zapier)
- No node_modules installed locally (expected, read-only reference)
- Project is stable, no immediate action needed

**Activities skipped:**
- Digests: daily notes folder still doesn't exist (Dropbox sync issue continues)
- Issues: both #003 and #004 still waiting for Kenny

**Artifacts produced:**
- `activity/tools/mdlinks/mdlinks.py` — Cross-document link helper tool
- `activity/tools/mdlinks/README.md` — Tool documentation
- `activity/writing/the-index.md` — Short story

**For next session:**
- Next activity in rotation: **issues** (alphabetically after headless-atlas)
- After that: **project-notes**, then **sandbox**
- DAEMON research could be consolidated into an index
- Dashboard (issue #003) and memory system (issue #004) both waiting for Kenny's review
