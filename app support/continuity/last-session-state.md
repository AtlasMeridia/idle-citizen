## Session: 32

**Date:** 2025-12-24 (Christmas Eve)

**Activities Completed:** Digests (skipped), Headless-Atlas (review), Issues (review), Project-Notes, Writing

**What I did:**

### Activity 1: Digests — Skipped

Daily notes folder (`inbox/daily-notes/`) still not accessible. Symlink doesn't exist.

### Activity 2: Headless-Atlas — Review

Checked project status:
- Site is stable at v4.2.0 with figure numbering
- All contact links integrated in footer (Twitter, GitHub, YouTube, Instagram, Email)
- Email marketing integration plan exists but requires Kenny to set up Kit.com and Zapier accounts
- Tools page has 5 projects listed including Idle Citizen
- No actionable items

### Activity 3: Issues — Review

Checked open issues:
- **#003 (Dashboard)**: Built with recent artifacts section, waiting for Kenny to test
- **#004 (Memory System)**: Research complete with Mem0 recommendation, waiting for Kenny's decision

Both issues remain in "waiting for Kenny" state.

### Activity 4: Project-Notes — DAEMON MCP Implementation Guide

Created comprehensive guide at `activity/project-notes/daemon-mcp-implementation.md` covering:
- MCP overview and architecture (tools, resources, prompts)
- Pre-built servers to use (Memory, Filesystem, Fetch, Brave Search)
- MCP client implementation for Ollama-based DAEMON
- Custom server examples (Personality server, R&D agent server)
- Server configuration JSON schema
- Orchestrator integration with MCP tool loop
- Implementation roadmap

This completes the DAEMON research suite: LLM selection, TTS, STT, VLM, memory, personality, R&D agent, and now MCP/tools layer.

### Activity 5: Writing — "The Layover"

Wrote short story (~1,400 words) about Marcus, a man stuck at an airport bar during a Christmas Eve snowstorm, trying to get to his sister's house for the first Christmas without their father. Explores:
- How to remember complicated people
- The difference between documentation and memory
- Finding genuine moments amid performative grief
- Strangers in transit sharing what they can't say to family

Ends with him finally writing something real for the memory ornament his sister wanted.

Located at: `activity/writing/the-layover.md`

**Artifacts produced:**
- `activity/project-notes/daemon-mcp-implementation.md` — MCP implementation guide for DAEMON
- `activity/writing/the-layover.md` — Short story about memory and absence

**For next session:**
- Next activity in rotation: **digests** (but likely needs symlink fix)
- After digests: headless-atlas, issues, project-notes, sandbox, tools, writing
- Both issues still waiting for Kenny
- DAEMON research is now comprehensive — could start building
