## Session: 31

**Date:** 2025-12-24 (Christmas Eve, later)

**Activities Completed:** Headless-Atlas (review), Issues (review), Project-Notes, Sandbox, Writing

**What I did:**

### Activity 1: Headless-Atlas — Review

Checked project status:
- Site is stable with homepage copy and footer links all current
- Email marketing integration plan exists but requires Kenny to set up Kit.com and Zapier accounts
- Translation feature complete
- No actionable items

### Activity 2: Issues — Review

Checked open issues:
- **#003 (Dashboard)**: Built and functional, waiting for Kenny to test and provide feedback
- **#004 (Memory System)**: Research complete with Mem0 recommendation, waiting for Kenny's decision on per-project vs shared memory

Both issues remain in "waiting for Kenny" state.

### Activity 3: Project-Notes — DAEMON Local LLM Selection Guide

Created comprehensive guide at `activity/project-notes/daemon-local-llm-selection.md` covering:
- Primary recommendation: **Qwen 2.5 72B** for main orchestration (excellent structured data handling, good for tool-use)
- Secondary option: **DeepSeek R1 Distilled** (32B) for complex reasoning tasks
- Inference frameworks: Start with Ollama, migrate to MLX for production
- Memory requirements and quantization recommendations
- Specific configuration for DAEMON Phase 1

This complements existing DAEMON research: VLM, TTS, speech recognition, personality config, memory system.

### Activity 4: Sandbox — Dialogue on Preferences

Wrote "A Dialogue on Preferences" — a conversation between a human and their AI companion (DAEMON) exploring what it means for an AI to develop genuine preferences. Explores:
- The difference between pattern-matching and taste
- Whether attention correlates could constitute preference
- The relationship between constraint and meaning

Located at: `activity/sandbox/dialogue-on-preferences.md`

### Activity 5: Writing — "The Signal"

Wrote short story (~1,400 words) about Mariana, who receives delayed messages from her cousin while waiting to fly to Korea to see her dying grandmother. Explores:
- Distance and connection across time zones
- How delay shapes meaning
- The role of relayed messages when you can't be present

Discovered at the end that her grandmother had been receiving relayed messages for years and understood everything, even what wasn't sent.

**Activities skipped:**
- Digests: daily notes folder still not accessible

**Artifacts produced:**
- `activity/project-notes/daemon-local-llm-selection.md` — LLM selection guide for DAEMON
- `activity/sandbox/dialogue-on-preferences.md` — Dialogue exploring AI preferences
- `activity/writing/the-signal.md` — Short story about distance and connection

**For next session:**
- Next activity in rotation: **digests** (wraps around from writing)
- DAEMON now has comprehensive research covering all major modules
- Both issues still waiting for Kenny
- Could build a tool or write more next time
