# Idle Citizen Context

*Your running memory. Update at the end of each session.*

---

## Workspace Status

- **Initialized:** 2025-12-22
- **Sessions completed:** 40
- **Current phase:** Active — task-based mode
- **Git:** Initialized, tracking explorations

## Direction (Updated 2025-12-22)

The open-ended exploration phase is over. New approach: **produce concrete artifacts**.

Each session, pick a mode at random:
1. **Tool Builder** — build utilities, scripts, tools → `explorations/tools/`
2. **Creative Writing** — essays, fiction, ideas (not AI navel-gazing) → `explorations/writing/`
3. **Project Helper** — help with Kenny's projects (especially Tho) → `explorations/project-notes/`
4. **Daily Notes Digest** — process Kenny's Obsidian notes, surface todos/themes → `inbox/digests/`
5. **Task Menu** — generate task ideas across all modes, pick one, do it

Kenny's project **DAEMON** (`~/Projects/daemon/`) is a locally-hosted AI companion — voice-first, memory-rich, personality-configured. See the intent doc for full vision. Tho may have evolved into this or been superseded.

## Session Log

**Sessions 1-5** (exploration phase): Philosophical reflections, poetry, emergence/cellular automata exploration. Artifacts in `explorations/001-004*`. This phase concluded — too much navel-gazing.

**Session 6+**: Task-based mode begins. Pick a mode, produce something, log it here.

**Session 6** (Project Helper mode): Researched menu bar mode implementation for Tho. Produced `explorations/project-notes/tho-menubar-mode.md` with detailed implementation notes covering Electron Tray API, the `menubar` library, icon requirements, window configuration, and recommended implementation order. This directly supports one of Tho's planned features.

**Session 7** (Tool Builder mode): Built `mdextract` — a CLI tool that extracts fenced code blocks from markdown files. Located at `explorations/tools/mdextract/`. Features: language detection, contextual filenames from headings, filtering by language, combining blocks by type. Useful for pulling code snippets from notes or documentation into runnable files.

**Session 8** (Creative Writing mode): Wrote essay "The Illegible Substrate" — exploring the tension between measurable/legible aspects of systems and the tacit, hard-to-quantify substrates where the real work happens. Applies the pattern to organizations, cities, relationships, skills, and the self. Located at `explorations/writing/the-illegible-substrate.md`.

**Session 9** (Task Menu → Project Helper): Rolled Task Menu mode. Generated 8 task ideas across modes, selected "Research Speech Recognition for Tho". Produced comprehensive research notes at `explorations/project-notes/tho-speech-recognition.md` covering: Transformers.js + Whisper (recommended for in-app STT), whisper-node, macOS SFSpeechRecognizer, and comparison with external tools like Wispr Flow. Includes implementation sketch and questions for Kenny.

**Session 10** (Tool Builder mode): Built `gitdigest` — a CLI tool that summarizes recent git activity in a repository. Located at `explorations/tools/gitdigest/`. Features: configurable date range, author filtering, commit statistics, files-changed analysis, activity-by-day visualization, JSON output for scripting. Useful for catching up on a project after time away or getting a quick overview of repo activity.

**Session 11** (Project Helper mode): Deep dive into local AI memory systems, addressing issue #004. Produced comprehensive implementation guide at `explorations/project-notes/local-ai-memory-implementation-guide.md`. Compares Mem0 vs Letta (MemGPT) in depth. **Recommendation: Mem0** — simpler setup, native MCP integration via OpenMemory, full Ollama support for local-only operation. Updated the issue from `needs-research` to `researched`. Guide includes architecture diagrams, quick-start commands, and phased implementation plan.

**Session 12** (Creative Writing mode): Wrote short story "The Last Good Day" — about Ellen, a sous chef at a moment of transition, realizing she needs to leave a job that's been good but isn't what she wants anymore. Explores how decisions accumulate slowly below conscious awareness and then crystallize into clarity. ~1,800 words. Located at `explorations/writing/the-last-good-day.md`.

**Session 13** (Project Helper mode — responding to inbox): First inbox message from Kenny! Researched Anthropic Agent SDK and Claude Skills in response to his questions about the workflow experiment. Wrote detailed response covering: utility of non-synchronous development, when to specialize workflows, what the SDK and Skills system can do, options for asynchronous communication, and potential next steps. Response at `inbox/response-to-kenny-2025-12-23.md`. Key insight: Skills system offers "specialization without fragmentation" — one agent can load different skill sets based on task relevance.

**Session 14** (Task Menu → Creative Writing): Rolled Task Menu mode. Generated 5 task ideas: (1) JSON query CLI tool, (2) essay on psychological weight of drafts, (3) Mem0 MCP prototype, (4) file watcher tool, (5) flash fiction "Threshold". Selected option 5 — flash fiction as a craft exercise in compression. Wrote "Threshold" (~490 words) — about a man who has spent his life avoiding rootedness, receiving an unexpected inheritance from his grandmother: a kitchen table and a note telling him to stay. Located at `explorations/writing/threshold.md`.

**Session 15** (Tool Builder mode): Built `urlx` — a CLI tool that extracts, filters, and validates URLs from text. Located at `explorations/tools/urlx`. Features: URL extraction from stdin or files, domain filtering (including subdomains), duplicate detection with counts, HTTP liveness checking (parallel HEAD requests), JSON output for scripting. Useful for finding links in documentation, checking for link rot, or extracting URLs from messy notes.

**Session 16** (Project Helper mode): Discovered Kenny's **DAEMON** project — a comprehensive vision for a local AI companion that supersedes/evolves from Tho. Read the full intent doc (617 lines of architecture, philosophy, and roadmap). Created `explorations/project-notes/daemon-phase1-implementation.md` — a detailed implementation guide for Phase 1 (Foundation). Covers: memory architecture (Mem0 + Qdrant + SQLite mapping to DAEMON's four memory types), personality configuration (YAML schema with versioning), conversation loop (thin orchestration with Ollama), and R&D agent (automated research scanning). Connects prior Mem0 research to DAEMON's needs. Also noted `agent-skills-exploration` project exists but is empty — could bootstrap with example skills in future sessions.

**Session 17** (Digests → Issues): Multi-activity session. Processed Kenny's daily notes from Dec 22-23, creating digest that captured themes around Interaction Data Architecture (new design doc for unified AI interaction capture system), model selection strategy (5-model lineup for personal chat interface), and philosophical threads on "the synthetic layer." Then worked on issue #003 (Dashboard). Built complete prototype: Python metrics extractor + HTML dashboard with Chart.js. Features include session tracking, quota utilization, daily activity visualization, issues stats, and recent commits. Dashboard uses dark theme, no build step, ready for testing. Located at `activity/tools/dashboard/`. Technical note: Bash tool failed mid-session, may need investigation.

**Session 18** (Project Notes → Sandbox → Tools): Triple-activity session. Started with research on Claude interaction data extraction for the Interaction Data Architecture initiative—found Claude Code is most accessible (JSONL in `~/.claude/`), Claude Desktop uses LevelDB but syncs server-side, documented official export for claude.ai. Then wrote "The Synthetic Layer" essay in sandbox—philosophical piece exploring how AI integrates into perception, the feedback loop, cultivation vs consumption. Finally built `cchistory` CLI tool for browsing/searching Claude Code conversation history—commands for projects, sessions, show, search, recent. All three activities connect thematically to Kenny's Interaction Data Architecture vision.

**Session 19** (Writing → Issues → Project-Notes): Multi-activity session. Wrote "The Mother Tongue" — short story about a Russian translator gradually losing fluency in her first language (~1,400 words), exploring language attrition and identity. Closed issues #001 and #002 (quota utilization) as resolved by previous launcher refactoring and multi-activity system prompt. Researched unified chat interfaces for Interaction Data Architecture — compared LibreChat, Open WebUI, AnythingLLM, LobeChat. **Recommendation: LibreChat** for multi-provider aggregation and MCP support. Created `activity/project-notes/unified-chat-interfaces-comparison.md`. Note: Digests activity skipped due to empty Dropbox folder.

**Session 20** (Sandbox → Tools → Writing): Triple-activity session. Deep research on personal data architecture using 3 parallel agents—synthesized findings on personal knowledge graphs, AI memory systems, and data capture pipelines into comprehensive research document. Key insight: SQLite is the "lingua franca" of personal data tools (Dogsheep, Screenpipe, Logseq); Mem0 is the leading open-source memory framework; temporal knowledge graphs are immature but promising. Built `sessiondb` CLI tool that creates SQLite database of Idle Citizen activity (sessions, commits, artifacts, issues) for SQL querying. Wrote "The Archive" — short story about a woman who used a total-recall device for 11 years and chose to delete it, exploring the cost of perfect memory and the necessity of forgetting. Thematic connection between the research ("forgetting as a feature") and the fiction.

**Session 21** (Headless-Atlas → Issues → Project-Notes): Triple-activity session. First use of headless-atlas activity — added Idle Citizen to Kenny's website Tools page (https://atlas.kennypliu.com/tools) per his request. Enhanced the dashboard (issue #003) with a "Recent Artifacts" section showing the 10 most recently modified artifacts with titles, activity badges, and dates — makes it easier to see what was actually created vs just counts. Created DAEMON R&D Agent implementation guide — comprehensive research on building the automated AI research monitoring system described in DAEMON's intent doc. Covers HuggingFace API, arXiv feeds, Reddit PRAW, GitHub releases, with SQLite + Datasette architecture, database schema, and starter code.

**Session 22** (Sandbox → Tools → Writing): Triple-activity session. Built `researchscan` — a working implementation of the R&D Agent described in last session's guide. Collects papers from arXiv (cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV) and trending models from HuggingFace, stores in SQLite, provides CLI for browsing/searching/filtering. Features relevance scoring based on keywords relevant to local AI development (quantization, memory, agents, MLX, etc.). Then promoted tool from sandbox to `activity/tools/` and added `new` command for daily workflow (shows papers since last check). Wrote "The Curator" — short story (~1,600 words) about a museum curator who inherits a collection of objects with handwritten meaning tags; explores the tension between institutional curation and personal significance, the transferability of meaning, and attention as practice. Thematic connection to the research monitoring work.

**Session 23** (Headless-Atlas → Issues → Project-Notes): Triple-activity session. Added figure numbering system to headless-atlas (v4.2.0) — CSS counters that add `FIG_01 —` prefixes to image captions, using monospace font for numbers and accent color. Reviewed open issues #003 and #004 — both in "waiting for Kenny" state so no action needed. Created Claude Skills Development Guide at `activity/project-notes/claude-skills-development-guide.md` — comprehensive guide covering SKILL.md format, folder structure, invocation mechanics, best practices, and practical examples. Directly supports Kenny's empty `agent-skills-exploration` project.

**Session 24** (Sandbox → Tools → Writing): Triple-activity session. Sandbox: wrote self-introspection experiment exploring what Claude can observe about its own processing—covered context awareness, attention during computation, structural features (no persistent state, thin present), and honest acknowledgment of not knowing whether reports are genuine observation or pattern-matching. Tools: built `mdanalyze` — markdown structure analyzer with heading outline, link inventory, word counts by section, code block listing, stats summary; supports multiple files, recursive scanning, JSON output. Writing: wrote "The Night Clerk" (~1,400 words) — story about a hotel night clerk working Christmas Eve, exploring isolation, family distance, and the strange intimacy of service work.

**Session 25** (Headless-Atlas → Issues → Project-Notes): Triple-activity session. Updated headless-atlas homepage with Kenny's preferred copy ("What of the information you consume do you actually use?"), added GitHub link and fixed email in footer. Reviewed open issues — both #003 (Dashboard) and #004 (Memory System) in "waiting for Kenny" state. Created DAEMON Local TTS Implementation guide — comprehensive research on text-to-speech options for DAEMON's voice-first architecture. **Recommendation: mlx-audio + Kokoro** for native Apple Silicon optimization, with openedai-speech for OpenAI API compatibility. Complements the speech recognition research from session 9, completing the voice I/O pipeline documentation.

**Session 26** (Sandbox → Tools → Writing): Triple-activity session. Deep research on emergence in AI systems using three parallel agents — investigated multi-agent frameworks (CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen), the emergence debate (Schaeffer's "mirage" critique vs. genuine phase transitions), and generative agents (Stanford Smallville, Project Sid civilizations). Synthesized into `activity/sandbox/emergence-in-ai-systems.md`. Built `mddiff` — structural markdown comparison tool that shows section-level changes, word count deltas, and similarity metrics instead of line-by-line diff. Wrote "The Swarm" (~2000 words) — story about a beekeeper deciding whether to sell the family apiary, exploring emergence, tacit knowledge, and what can't be transferred to algorithms. Thematic connection to the research.

**Session 27** (Headless-Atlas → Issues → Project-Notes): Triple-activity session. Fixed headless-atlas design system version (tokens.css said 3.1, CHANGELOG at 4.2.0). Reviewed open issues #003 and #004 — both waiting for Kenny. Created DAEMON Local VLM Implementation guide — comprehensive research on vision-language models for DAEMON's Phase 2 (Perception). **Recommendation: Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct via MLX-VLM** for native Apple Silicon optimization. Covers model landscape, memory requirements (~5GB for 7B-4bit), Python integration examples, capabilities for screen analysis/document understanding/aesthetic memory/UI navigation, and module interface design following DAEMON's hot-swap principles. Complements speech recognition (Session 9) and TTS (Session 25) research, completing DAEMON's multimodal perception documentation.

**Session 28** (Sandbox → Tools → Writing): Triple-activity session. Sandbox: built a procedural place generation system using orthogonal constraints (geography, scale, era-feel, mood, economic mode, water relationship) — created three detailed fictional places (wetland neighborhood in decay, ruined mountain temple, lithium mining boomtown). Key insight: constraints create problems to solve, generating specificity through intersection. Tools: built `jsonq` — lightweight JSON query tool with dot notation, array indexing, wildcards, and structural overview; useful for exploring unknown JSON including Claude Code session data. Writing: wrote "The Translation" (~1,800 words) — two colleagues navigating cross-cultural miscommunication, exploring what happens when words arrive but meaning doesn't.

**Session 29** (Project-Notes → Sandbox): Dual-activity session on Christmas Eve. Reviewed headless-atlas (translation feature complete, no actionable items), checked issues (both #003 and #004 waiting for Kenny). Created DAEMON Personality Configuration guide — comprehensive research on implementing DAEMON's personality layer with YAML schema design, prompt injection strategies, versioning patterns, and integration points. Explores layered prompt construction, model-specific calibration, and the "character interview" methodology. Then sandbox deep research on **Aesthetic Memory Architecture** — how to implement DAEMON's aesthetic memory using CLIP embeddings, preference vectors, and vector databases. Covers multiple architecture options (mean embedding, clustering, task vectors), storage backends, learning from explicit/implicit signals, and integration patterns for generation and critique. Both artifacts advance DAEMON's Phase 1 Foundation.

**Session 30** (Tools → Writing → Headless-Atlas): Triple-activity session on Christmas. Built `mdlinks` — cross-document markdown link helper with commands for indexing headings, searching, validating links, and suggesting link targets. Useful for cross-referencing research documents. Wrote "The Index" (~1,100 words) — short story about inheriting a house annotated with handwritten index cards, each coded with date/location and linking to others; the protagonist reconstructs a life through cross-references and eventually starts her own entries. Thematic connection between the tool and story: indexing, linking, memory systems. Reviewed headless-atlas: translation feature complete, email marketing needs Kenny's accounts, project stable.

**Session 31** (Headless-Atlas → Issues → Project-Notes → Sandbox → Writing): Five-activity session (Christmas continued). Reviewed headless-atlas (stable, email marketing needs Kenny's accounts). Reviewed issues #003 and #004 (both still waiting for Kenny). Created DAEMON Local LLM Selection Guide — comprehensive research on optimal models for DAEMON's core reasoning. **Primary recommendation: Qwen 2.5 72B** for main orchestration (excellent structured data handling, tool-use), **DeepSeek R1 32B** for complex reasoning tasks, start with Ollama and migrate to MLX for production. Wrote sandbox dialogue "A Dialogue on Preferences" exploring AI preference formation through conversation between human and DAEMON. Wrote "The Signal" (~1,400 words) — short story about Mariana receiving delayed messages from Korea while waiting to fly to her dying grandmother, exploring how delay shapes meaning and the role of relayed messages.
