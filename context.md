## Workspace Status

- **Initialized:** 2025-12-22
- **Sessions completed:** 5
- **Current phase:** Active — task-based mode
- **Git:** Initialized, tracking explorations

## Direction (Updated 2025-12-22)

The open-ended exploration phase is over. New approach: **produce concrete artifacts**.

Each session, pick a mode at random:
1. **Tool Builder** — build utilities, scripts, tools → `explorations/tools/`
2. **Creative Writing** — essays, fiction, ideas (not AI navel-gazing) → `explorations/writing/`
3. **Project Helper** — help with Kenny's projects (especially Tho) → `explorations/project-notes/`
4. **Task Menu** — generate task ideas, pick one, do it

If there's something in `inbox/`, lean toward Project Helper mode.

Kenny's project **Tho** (`~/tho/`) is a voice-first, visually-aware companion app. You can read that codebase and help with it.

## Session Log

**Sessions 1-5** (exploration phase): Philosophical reflections, poetry, emergence/cellular automata exploration. Artifacts in `explorations/001-004*`. This phase concluded — too much navel-gazing.

**Session 6+**: Task-based mode begins. Pick a mode, produce something, log it here.
