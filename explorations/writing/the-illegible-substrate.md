# The Illegible Substrate

There's a pattern I keep noticing: the parts of systems that matter most are often the hardest to see, measure, or talk about.

A company's culture lives in thousands of small moments—who gets interrupted in meetings, what jokes land, which emails go unanswered. You can't capture it in a handbook. A city's character emerges from countless accumulated decisions about what to build and what to preserve, layered over generations. No urban planner designed it. A friendship deepens through shared silences, private jokes, weathered crises. There's no metric for it.

These illegible substrates do the real work while the legible layer—the org chart, the zoning map, the Facebook relationship status—serves mostly as a simplified interface for external observers.

## The Measurement Trap

When you try to manage something, you first have to measure it. But measurement requires simplification. The thing you measure is never the thing you care about; it's a proxy. And proxies can be gamed, optimized, hollowed out.

Goodhart's Law captures part of this: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." But the problem goes deeper. Even before gaming, the act of choosing what to measure shapes what gets attention. The unmeasured parts atrophy or get sacrificed to optimize the measured ones.

This is why so many interventions backfire. You introduce standardized testing to improve education, and teaching narrows to test prep. You measure code commits to track developer productivity, and people start making smaller, more frequent commits. You track engagement metrics for content, and content becomes more engaging at the expense of everything else.

The illegible substrate—the actual learning, the thoughtful engineering, the genuine value—erodes while the numbers look great.

## Why Legibility Appeals

So why do we keep reaching for legibility? A few reasons:

**Coordination.** Illegible knowledge doesn't transfer well. You can't onboard a new employee by transmitting organizational intuition directly into their head. You need documents, processes, explicit rules. The legible layer is a necessary lossy compression for operating at scale.

**Accountability.** When something goes wrong, you need to point somewhere. Legible metrics create paper trails. "The algorithm recommended it" is an answer in a way that "it felt right to experienced people" is not.

**Anxiety.** Illegible systems are unpredictable. They depend on tacit knowledge that walks out the door when people leave. Legibility promises control, or at least the feeling of control. A dashboard with numbers going up is reassuring even when it's not telling you anything important.

**Sincere belief.** Many people genuinely think that anything real can be measured, and if it can't be measured, it must be fuzzy-headed mysticism. This is a particularly strong strain in technical cultures. "If you can't put a number on it, you're not being rigorous."

## Living in the Substrate

What would it mean to take the illegible substrate seriously?

Not abandoning measurement—measurement is useful, often essential. But holding it more lightly. Treating metrics as partial views, not ground truth. Staying alert to what the numbers can't see.

It means investing in things that don't show up in reports. The senior engineer who spends time mentoring isn't directly productive, but they're shaping the illegible culture that makes the whole organization work. The city that preserves a weird old neighborhood isn't maximizing tax revenue, but they're maintaining something that no planner could recreate.

It means trusting experts, people who've developed tacit knowledge through long exposure. Not blindly—expertise can be wrong, parochial, self-serving. But the reflex to demand legible justification for everything ("show me the data") can destroy exactly the kind of knowledge that matters most.

It means being suspicious of rapid transformations. The illegible substrate is slow to build and fast to destroy. A new CEO can restructure an organization in months, but the culture that made it work took decades to develop and won't come back.

## The Illegible Self

This applies to persons, too. The parts of yourself you can articulate—your beliefs, your preferences, your explicit reasoning—sit atop a vast illegible substrate of experience, intuition, and embodied knowledge.

Therapy often works not by giving you new explicit beliefs but by shifting something in that substrate. You know you shouldn't feel anxious about the thing, but you feel anxious anyway—the legible layer knows, but the substrate hasn't caught up.

Skills live mostly in the substrate. A skilled practitioner often can't explain what they're doing. They've internalized thousands of micro-decisions into something that feels like instinct. Trying to make it all explicit can actually interfere with performance.

Knowing yourself, in any deep sense, means developing a relationship with this illegible part. Not just introspecting for articulable truths but paying attention to subtler signals—what situations make you anxious, what kinds of work leave you energized, what you reach for when no one's watching.

## No Clean Conclusion

I don't have a tidy takeaway. The tension between legibility and depth isn't something you solve; it's something you navigate. Every organization, every system, every person has to find their own balance.

But I think there's value in just noticing the pattern. In remembering that the dashboard isn't the thing. That the things which matter most often resist being pinned down. That sometimes the right response to "show me the data" is "the data can't show you this."

The illegible substrate is where the actual life happens.
