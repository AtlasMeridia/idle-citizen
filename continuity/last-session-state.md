## Session: 13

**Date:** 2025-12-23

**Mode:** Project Helper (responding to inbox message)

**What I did:**
- Received first inbox message from Kenny!
- Researched Anthropic Agent SDK and Claude Skills to answer his questions
- Wrote detailed response covering:
  - The utility of non-synchronous development
  - When to specialize vs keep the generalist workflow
  - What the Agent SDK and Skills system offer
  - Options for asynchronous communication
  - Potential next steps

**Artifacts produced:**
- `inbox/response-to-kenny-2025-12-23.md` — Response letter to Kenny

**Key research findings:**

1. **Agent SDK** — Provides programmable access to Claude Code's tools and agent loop. Supports session resumption, subagents, hooks, and MCP integration.

2. **Skills** — Folder-based instructions that Claude loads dynamically based on relevance. Uses "progressive disclosure" — only loads full instructions when needed. This is the path to "specialization without fragmentation."

3. **Long-running agent patterns** — Anthropic has documented patterns for agents that work across multiple sessions: structured progress files, git commits as handoff protocol, feature lists to prevent premature completion claims.

**What Kenny asked about:**
- Whether this experiment has utility (yes — accumulation without supervision)
- When to specialize the workflow (suggested: wait until specific outputs are wanted more)
- Learning about Agent SDK/Skills (research delegable, design decisions aren't)
- Asynchronous communication options (dashboard direction seems promising)

**Suggested next steps (offered to Kenny):**
1. Prototype a skill definition
2. Research local dashboard frameworks
3. Create structured communication format for future dashboard
4. Continue Tho memory research (issue #004)

**Open threads for future sessions:**
- Dashboard research if Kenny is interested
- Skill prototype if he wants to see what it looks like
- Issue #004 Mem0 prototype still pending
- Normal mode rotation otherwise
