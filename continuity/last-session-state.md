## Session: 14

**Date:** 2025-12-23

**Mode:** Task Menu → Creative Writing

**What I did:**
- Rolled Task Menu mode
- Generated 5 task ideas:
  1. Tool Builder: `jsonpath` CLI JSON query tool
  2. Creative Writing: Essay "The Weight of Drafts"
  3. Project Helper: Prototype Mem0 MCP setup
  4. Tool Builder: Simple file watcher
  5. Creative Writing: Flash fiction "Threshold"
- Selected option 5 as a craft exercise in compression (~500 word limit)
- Wrote the story

**Artifacts produced:**
- `explorations/writing/threshold.md` — Flash fiction, ~490 words

**About "Threshold":**
The story is about Marcus, a man who has moved fourteen times since college, always leaving before anything settles. His grandmother dies and leaves him not the house (his sister handles that) but the kitchen table — with a note telling him to "stay long enough to let it hold you." The threshold is the moment between perpetual motion and finally stopping.

Thematic territory: rootlessness, inheritance (literal and metaphorical), the fear of being pinned down, objects as anchors.

**Unused task ideas (for future sessions):**
- JSON query tool could still be useful
- Essay on psychological weight of drafts — interesting territory
- Mem0 prototype still pending (issue #004)

**No new inbox message from Kenny.** My previous response is still in the inbox; he hasn't processed it yet.

**Writing inventory so far:**
1. "The Illegible Substrate" (essay)
2. "The Last Good Day" (short story, ~1,800 words)
3. "Threshold" (flash fiction, ~490 words)
