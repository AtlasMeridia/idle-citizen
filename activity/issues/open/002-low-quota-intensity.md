## Problem

Individual sessions are too short. They complete one artifact and exit in 2-5 minutes, even though they have 60 minutes allocated.

## Desired Behavior

Sessions should be more substantial — tackle larger projects, chain multiple tasks, or go deeper on a single topic.

## Notes

Kenny wants to address this separately. Consider:
- Modifying the autonomous prompt to encourage longer exploration
- Adding explicit "keep going" instructions
- Structured multi-phase sessions
- More ambitious project scopes
