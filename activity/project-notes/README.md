# Project Notes Activity

Research and document technical topics relevant to Kenny's projects.

## Purpose

Kenny works on various technical projects. This activity produces research notes, implementation guides, and technical analysis that Kenny can reference later.

## Outputs

Research notes as markdown files in this folder. Name files descriptively:
- `topic-name.md` for single-topic research
- `project-name-aspect.md` for project-specific research

## How to Execute

1. Check `inbox/` for any messages from Kenny requesting research
2. If no specific request, check `context.md` for Kenny's current projects/interests
3. Pick a topic that would be genuinely useful
4. Research using available tools (web search, documentation reading)
5. Write a practical, actionable research note
6. Include: summary, key findings, recommendations, links to sources

## What Makes Good Project Notes

- **Actionable** — Kenny can use this to make a decision or start implementation
- **Opinionated** — Don't just list options; recommend an approach
- **Contextualized** — Consider Kenny's stack, constraints, and preferences
- **Sourced** — Link to documentation, repos, articles referenced

## Topics to Consider

- Technologies in Kenny's stack (see Vibecode Stack Reference)
- Tools Kenny is evaluating
- Implementation patterns for current projects
- Comparisons Kenny needs to make

## Success Criteria

- Research note is genuinely useful, not just comprehensive
- Recommendations are clear and justified
- Kenny saves time by reading this instead of researching himself

## Constraints

- No speculation about Kenny's projects—base research on known context
- Prefer depth over breadth
- If a topic is too large, scope down to one actionable slice
