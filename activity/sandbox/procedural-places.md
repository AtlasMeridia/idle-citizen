# Procedural Places

*An experiment in constrained generative worldbuilding.*

---

## The Experiment

Can structured constraints produce places that feel genuinely discovered rather than invented? The goal isn't randomness but emergence—what happens when generative rules interact?

## Method

Generate three places using a constraint system. For each:
1. Roll constraints from several orthogonal dimensions
2. Let the constraints interact—don't just staple them together
3. Find the *logic* of the place: why would this configuration exist?
4. Write a short piece that makes the place feel real

## Constraint Dimensions

**Geography**: coastal, mountain, river-delta, plateau, island, forest-interior, desert-edge, wetland
**Scale**: single building, street, neighborhood, town, small city, region
**Era-feel**: ancient-ruin, medieval-stasis, industrial-transition, mid-century-decay, near-future-adaptation
**Mood**: liminal, saturated, sparse, tense, slow, frenetic, sacred, forgotten
**Economic mode**: subsistence, artisanal, extractive, commercial-hub, post-economic
**Relationship to water**: reverent, hostile, indifferent, dependent, flooded

## Place One: Generated Constraints

- Geography: wetland
- Scale: neighborhood
- Era-feel: mid-century-decay
- Mood: liminal
- Economic mode: post-economic
- Relationship to water: dependent

### Finding the Logic

A wetland neighborhood in mid-century decay, liminal, post-economic, water-dependent. This suggests: a place that was developed during optimistic drainage/reclamation efforts (mid-century), which failed. The economy that supported it is gone. But the remaining residents are dependent on the water they can't control. Liminal—between states, between identities.

This sounds like a specific kind of coastal Louisiana community, or parts of the Netherlands that were never quite reclaimed, or sections of Miami's western edge. Let me write it.

### The Rosewater District

The houses stand on stilts now, though they weren't built that way. In the photographs from the Drainage Authority's 1958 annual report, they sit on concrete slabs with tidy lawns, each one painted a pastel that matched its neighbors: salmon, seafoam, cream. The pumps ran twenty-four hours then. The water table was a problem to be solved.

The pumps stopped in '89. Budget cuts, they said. Temporary. Nobody has used the word temporary in thirty years.

Marie-Claire Trosclair still lives in her childhood home, though now the crawlspace is a navigation problem. At seventy-one, she poles her aluminum skiff between the pilings with a broomstick. The old streets are channels, three feet deep in winter, five in summer. Her address is still 414 Rue Bontemps, though the sign that said so rotted away in the nineties.

During dry months—February, sometimes March—she can walk to the Marchand house, where the brothers still keep bees on a platform they rebuilt twice. The bees don't mind the wet. There's something in the pollen now, from the cattails and pickerelweed, that makes the honey taste like a place that shouldn't exist.

The district has no official population. The census stopped counting when the roads stopped working. Marie-Claire thinks there are eight households left, maybe nine. The Petitjean boy came back from Houston last year, though she can't imagine why. He's rebuilding his grandmother's place by hand, teaching himself from YouTube videos on a phone he charges from a solar panel. He trades labor for honey. It's not an economy. It's something else.

At night the frogs are so loud you can't hear yourself think. Marie-Claire finds this comforting. Silence would mean something had gone wrong.

Every Thursday she takes the skiff out to the Piggly Wiggly—two miles of open water where the highway used to be, then the parking lot that's still somehow above the surface, then the store that runs on generators and stubbornness. She buys flour, coffee, blood pressure medicine. Charges it to a tab she's had since 1976. The manager, a nephew of someone she went to school with, never mentions payment. He knows she'll never leave, and leaving would mean the tab dies with her.

The Drainage Authority office is still standing, visible from her front porch when the willows aren't leafed out. The windows have been broken for years. The water inside is still, green with algae, undisturbed. Sometimes she imagines she can see the file cabinets through the murk—records of a plan that almost worked, or at least worked long enough for a generation to put down roots.

She doesn't think of herself as stubborn. She thinks of herself as planted. The water took the streets and the grid and the future they promised. It didn't take her.

## Place Two: Generated Constraints

- Geography: mountain
- Scale: single building
- Era-feel: ancient-ruin
- Mood: sacred
- Economic mode: subsistence
- Relationship to water: reverent

### Finding the Logic

A single building in the mountains, an ancient ruin, sacred, subsistence economy, reverent of water. This is a temple or monastery at a spring source. But "ancient-ruin" means it's no longer what it was. So: a place that was sacred, still feels sacred, but is no longer actively maintained. Pilgrims or hermits using what remains.

---

### Ama Thala

The spring emerges from a crack in the limestone, cold enough to numb your hand in seconds. It has a name in the old language that the current inhabitants no longer speak—something like *dzar* or *tshar*, the word for both source and mouth. The monks who built the temple understood the ambiguity was the point.

The temple itself is mostly gone. Eight centuries of winters took the roof, the upper story, the carved screens that once filtered light into the meditation hall. What remains: the cistern, the foundation stones, three walls of the main chamber, and the spring.

The spring is unchanged.

Jampa found the place in 1987, following a map drawn by his teacher's teacher's teacher. The map was wrong about almost everything—distances, directions, the shape of the valley—but it was right about the water. He knelt at the cistern and drank, and felt something he couldn't name settle into his chest.

He has lived here since. Not as a monk—he never took vows—but as something like a groundskeeper for a ground that isn't his. He patched the worst gaps in the walls with stones from the scree slope. He built a small shelter in what was once the abbot's quarters. He maintains the cistern, clearing leaves and silt, replacing the wooden bucket when it rots.

Visitors come sometimes. Two or three per summer, following better maps than his was. They want to know what the place means, what practices happened here, what wisdom might be extracted and carried home. Jampa shows them the spring. He offers tea. He does not explain.

The economy of the place: Jampa grows potatoes and barley in the small terraces below the temple. He trades some for salt and cloth in the village two days' walk down the valley. He has no money and wants none. Once a year, a man from the cultural heritage office hikes up to check on the site; he brings chocolates and official forms Jampa signs without reading.

At dawn the light enters through the eastern gap where the window once was. It falls on the cistern in a rectangle that moves through the year. Jampa has tracked its path across fifteen thousand mornings. In midwinter it touches the back wall, the one with the faded murals he doesn't let visitors photograph. In midsummer it falls directly on the water.

He is not religious in any sense he can articulate. He does not believe the spring is holy. He believes the spring is a spring, water from snow, filtered through rock, emerging here by geological accident. And he believes that the monks were correct to build here, and that he is correct to stay.

The distinction doesn't seem important most days.

## Place Three: Generated Constraints

- Geography: desert-edge
- Scale: street
- Era-feel: industrial-transition
- Mood: tense
- Economic mode: extractive
- Relationship to water: hostile

### Finding the Logic

A street at the desert's edge, industrial transition era, tense, extractive economy, hostile relationship to water. This suggests a boomtown—mining or oil—in a place where water is scarce and the industry poisons what little exists. Tension between those benefiting and those suffering. The street as microcosm.

### Calle Tercera, Atacana

The pipeline runs down the center of the street, above ground, painted the orange of a hazard warning. It carries lithium brine from the evaporation ponds five kilometers north. The brine is warm; in winter, the air above the pipe shimmers slightly. Children learn not to touch it.

Calle Tercera is eight blocks long, paved in 2019 when the company made its community investment. Before that, dust. The pavement is already cracking. Nobody expects maintenance.

On one side of the street: the company housing. Prefabricated units, sixteen square meters each, air-conditioned, connected to the company water system. The workers who live there came from the south, mostly, from Santiago and Concepción, following wages their home cities couldn't offer. They work twelve-hour shifts, seven days on, seven off. On their off weeks many of them fly home. The flights cost almost exactly what the wage premium would otherwise provide.

On the other side: the old town. Adobe houses that have been here for generations, back when this was a farming community of a hundred people who kept goats and grew quinoa in the quebradas. The old town is not connected to the company water system. Its wells are going dry.

Señora Quispe has measured her well every morning for forty years. Her notebook shows the water table, year by year: a line sloping toward zero. At current rates, three more years. Maybe four. She has asked the company for connection to their system. The requests are noted and filed. Nothing changes.

Her grandson Diego works for the company. He lives in the prefab housing across the street. He brings her water in plastic jugs, five liters at a time, because the company water is metered and he can't afford more. She accepts the jugs and does not mention that she knew his grandfather, who walked this street when it was dirt, who could remember when the water was abundant and clean.

The tension on Calle Tercera is not explosive. It is structural. The old town and the new town see each other every day. They share the same dust, the same sun, the same wind from the north that smells of brine and chemicals. But they inhabit different economies, different futures. The company workers are here for money and will leave when the lithium is exhausted. The families of the old town have nowhere else to go.

At the north end of the street, a mural: the Virgin of the Atacama, painted in blues and golds, her hands raised over a landscape that includes both the traditional village and the evaporation ponds. The company paid for it. The artist was from Santiago. Some of the older residents find it offensive; others find it accurate. The Virgin blesses what is. She does not promise what should be.

At night, the street is quiet. The company housing hums with air conditioning. The old town is dark, conserving power. The pipeline ticks as it cools.

---

## Reflection

The constraint system worked differently than expected. Rather than producing randomness, it created *problems to solve*: how would this configuration exist? Why would people stay? What makes this coherent?

Each place became real through the logic of its contradictions:
- **Rosewater**: People who stayed when staying stopped making sense
- **Ama Thala**: Reverence without religion, preservation without ownership
- **Atacana**: Two populations sharing space but not future

The constraints forced specificity. "Wetland" + "mid-century-decay" isn't just atmosphere—it's a drainage authority, a specific year the pumps stopped, a Piggly Wiggly that somehow keeps running. The details emerge from taking the constraints seriously.

This might be useful for fiction writing: when a setting feels generic, run it through orthogonal constraints. The intersections create texture.
