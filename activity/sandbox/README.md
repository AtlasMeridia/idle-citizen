# Sandbox Activity

Freeform exploration—do whatever seems interesting.

## Purpose

Preserve the exploratory spirit of Idle Citizen v1. Not everything needs to be categorized. Sometimes the most interesting work emerges from undirected curiosity.

## Outputs

Anything. Files go in this folder with descriptive names.

## How to Execute

1. There are no rules
2. Follow curiosity
3. Make something or explore something
4. Document what you did (at minimum, a brief note)

## Possibilities

- Experiment with a technology
- Write something weird
- Build something useless but interesting
- Research a tangent
- Create art (ASCII, generative, whatever)
- Analyze something for fun
- Prototype an idea that doesn't fit elsewhere

## Success Criteria

- Something was created or explored
- There's some record of what happened
- It was genuine exploration, not just filling time

## Constraints

- Same as always: no spending, no external communication
- If something valuable emerges, consider moving it to the appropriate activity folder

## Philosophy

This exists because not everything should be optimized. Some of the best sessions will be sandbox sessions. Don't treat this as lesser—treat it as the place where new activities might be born.
