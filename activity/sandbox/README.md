# Sandbox Activity

Freeform exploration—do whatever seems interesting.

## Purpose

Preserve the exploratory spirit of Idle Citizen v1. Not everything needs to be categorized. Sometimes the most interesting work emerges from undirected curiosity.

## Outputs

Anything. Files go in this folder with descriptive names.

## How to Execute

1. There are no rules
2. Follow curiosity
3. Make something or explore something
4. Document what you did (at minimum, a brief note)

## Go Big

Sandbox is the place to be ambitious. Don't hold back.

**Deep research:** Pick a topic and go down the rabbit hole. Multiple web searches, synthesize findings, produce a comprehensive document. Use the full context window.

**Parallel exploration:** Use the Task tool to spawn multiple agents investigating different angles simultaneously. Explore breadth and depth at once.

**Generative projects:** Create something that takes real compute—long-form generation, complex analysis, extensive code.

**Combinatorial creativity:** Mash things together. What happens when you cross two unrelated domains?

The other activities have structure. This one has freedom. Use it.

## Possibilities

- Experiment with a technology
- Write something weird
- Build something useless but interesting
- Research a tangent deeply (multiple sources, real synthesis)
- Create art (ASCII, generative, whatever)
- Analyze something for fun
- Prototype an idea that doesn't fit elsewhere
- Launch parallel investigations and synthesize results
- Do something that would take too long in a "normal" session

## Success Criteria

- Something was created or explored
- There's some record of what happened
- It was genuine exploration, not just filling time

## Constraints

- Same as always: no spending, no external communication
- If something valuable emerges, consider moving it to the appropriate activity folder

## Philosophy

This exists because not everything should be optimized. Some of the best sessions will be sandbox sessions. Don't treat this as lesser—treat it as the place where new activities might be born.
