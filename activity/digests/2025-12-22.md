## Notable Quote

> "The models next year will have a 100x improvement over this year. That's incredible. It's crazy. You have to put it in the context: Most of our history has been 2x every 18 months. The last 10 years has been 10x year-over-year. Which is just insane. That's why you're seeing all this insane capability. But a 100x step up year within the insanity is a next level of insanity."

## Patterns

- **Returning home**: Notes from 12-17 suggest returning to California from travel, processing that transition
- **Grounding practices**: Mention of re-initiating grounding practices during a mentally tough period
- **The Four Agreements**: Referenced as a touchstone (keep word impeccable, don't take personally, try your best, don't assume)
- **Avoid misery vs seek joy**: "The folly is to seek joy. The shrewd approach is to avoid misery."
- **AI as cognitive layer**: "The layer forming between you and how you think is the synthetic layer, AI."
