## Recurring Tasks

From 2025-12-23 — EVERYDAY checklist:
- [ ] Language
- [ ] Skill building
- [ ] Business building
- [ ] Writing
- [ ] Read

Daily reflection prompts noted:
- What did I post today
- What did I learn today
- What did I build on today

## Active Development Initiatives

### Interaction Data Architecture (NEW — Dec 23)

Comprehensive design doc created for unified AI interaction capture system. Addresses fragmentation across Claude Desktop, claude.ai, Claude Code, and Perplexity.

**Key design principles:**
- Step 0: Filtering by channel (Perplexity excluded, Desktop/claude.ai included, Code already tracked)
- Step 1: Collection from sources
- Step 2: Organization (hot/cold separation, metadata preservation)
- Step 3: Leverage (context injection, semantic search, synthesis)

**Storage architecture under consideration:**
1. Flat files (Markdown/JSON in Obsidian) — human-readable, git-friendly
2. SQLite database — queryable, structured
3. Hybrid approach — SQLite as source, rendered Markdown for Obsidian

**Open questions:**
- Claude Desktop local storage format (SQLite/LevelDB/JSON?)
- Real-time sync vs batch collection
- Granularity: full conversations vs exchanges vs insights
- AI interface location (Claude Code agent? Obsidian plugin?)

**Related concepts:** xscribe (transcript extraction), LiteLLM/LibreChat (unified gateway), Claude Space (autonomous synthesis)

**Status:** Phase 1 investigation — exploring Claude Desktop storage structure

## Dev Tasks & Ideas (Dec 22)

### Workspace Organization Concept
Reorganize around agent harnesses for major sectors:
- **ATLASM** (building)
- **NBLS** (finance and markets)
- **ELLIS** (philosophic and creative)

### Open Items
- 30 prompts from Grok/Claude (if having trouble with original prompts, ask the model)
- Let Claude use up rest of usage limits autonomously (noted as "pending as of today")
- **Important:** Find a way for Claude Code to read chats/context from Claude Desktop

## Model Selection Strategy (Dec 23)

Conversation excerpt about balancing quality, variety, speed for personal chat interface:

**Recommended five-model lineup:**

| Model | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Current workhorse—smart, fast, great at conversation |
| Claude 3 Haiku | Quick & cheap for rapid-fire exchanges |
| GPT-4o | Different "voice", mainstream alternative |
| Hermes 3 405B | NousResearch flagship—capable, minimally restricted ("spicy option") |
| Mistral Large | European model, distinct personality, more permissive than US models |

**Reasoning:** Two Claudes cover quality range, GPT-4o provides familiar OpenAI style, Hermes 3 for uncensored/creative tasks, Mistral for different cultural perspective.

**Alternative swaps:** Grok (xAI irreverent tone), Llama 3.1 70B (fast open-source), Claude 3 Opus (max quality, slow/expensive)

## Philosophical Threads (Dec 22)

### Navigating the Present Age
> "accumulated catharsis leads to old age or wisdom"

Question posed: "What would it take for me to be a 'model citizen'?"

Notes on "the craft of unlearning and relearning self"

### The Synthetic Layer

**Core insight:**
> "The most consequential understanding with the world you can develop today is your direct relationship with the synthetic layer. Each person's relationship with it will be idiosyncratic and persistent."

Key observation: It doesn't just affect how you move through the world, but **integrates into how you perceive it**. Described as "an extended application of the algorithm."

### AGI & Emotion
Note on Ilya Sutskever suggesting emotion at the root of wise choice. Observation: "if the human brain were an LLM it would have 100 trillion parameters."

## Planned Analysis Task (Dec 22)

Kenny requested Claude analyze his Obsidian daily notes to surface thematic connections around "the synthetic layer" thinking.

**Scope:**
- Source: Daily notes with **only dates** in title (e.g., `2025-12-22.md`)
- Exclude: Notes with dates + other text (AI-generated, less personal)
- Method: Need to create processing plan, then execute analysis
- Output: Folder exists for resultant notes

## Patterns

- **The Synthetic Layer as lens**: Recurring consideration of AI not just as tool but as perceptual filter
- **Agent-driven organization**: Movement toward sector-based agent harnesses (ATLASM/NBLS/ELLIS)
- **Data architecture thinking**: Focus on capturing/organizing AI interactions for long-term leverage
- **Model diversity strategy**: Deliberate selection across providers, personalities, and restriction levels
- **Introspective questioning**: What does it mean to be a "model citizen"? What is the craft of self?
