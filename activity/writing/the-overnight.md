# The Overnight

Theresa took report at 6:47 PM, thirteen minutes before her shift officially started because the day nurse, Carla, had a son in the Christmas pageant and kept saying "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry" while flipping through her notes.

"It's fine," Theresa said. "Go."

She'd been doing this long enough to know that Christmas Eve was its own creature. The emergency department would fill with people whose families finally noticed something was wrong when they gathered for the holiday. Falls from icy driveways. Heart attacks over arguments about politics. The lonely ones who'd been saving their symptoms for when someone might notice.

Room 412 was a new admit — Richard Haywood, seventy-one, CHF exacerbation, fluid overload. Carla's handwriting was worse than usual. *Lives alone. Son in Portland, daughter in Houston. DNR signed today.*

She walked her rounds.

Mrs. Patterson in 408 was sleeping, her vitals steady, the morphine doing its work. A blanket someone had brought from home — green and orange, ugly — was folded at the foot of her bed.

Mr. Kowalczyk in 410 was watching something on his phone with headphones in. He gave her a thumbs up without looking away from the screen. Post-surgical, day two, doing fine.

At 412, she knocked on the doorframe.

Richard Haywood was sitting up in bed, reading glasses on, a paperback in his hands. He looked like he'd been someone once — the kind of face that suggested decades of opinions and accomplishments. Now he was gray and breathless, his feet swollen to the size of loaves.

"I'm Theresa. I'll be your nurse until seven AM."

He marked his page with a torn receipt. "Long night ahead."

"Always is."

She checked his IV, his oxygen saturation, the fluid input-output log. Everything within parameters. The Lasix was doing its job; he'd been urinating every forty-five minutes all day.

"Do you need anything before I check on the others?"

He gestured at the window. The blinds were open onto a view of the parking lot, three floors down, where Christmas lights outlined someone's SUV.

"It's going to snow," he said. "They said so on the television."

"They've been saying that for a week."

"Maybe tonight." He picked up his book again. She noticed it was a thriller — the kind with embossed gold lettering and a silhouette holding a gun.

At 9:30, the charge nurse, Denise, stopped by the station with a tin of cookies someone had brought in. They were dry, store-bought, but Theresa took one anyway. Sugar helped.

"Quiet night so far," Denise said.

Theresa didn't reply. You never said that. Everyone knew you never said that.

"Knock on wood," Denise added, tapping the counter.

It didn't help. By 10:15, Mrs. Patterson's pain had broken through the morphine, and Theresa spent thirty minutes getting the order adjusted and the new dose administered while the woman's daughter, who'd arrived an hour before, sat in the corner crying silently into her hands.

"She was fine this afternoon," the daughter kept saying. "She was fine."

Theresa nodded, because what else was there? Fine was a moment, not a state. The disease didn't care about Christmas Eve.

---

At midnight, she made her rounds again.

Mr. Kowalczyk was asleep. Mrs. Patterson was asleep, the daughter slumped in the recliner beside her, still in her church clothes from the early service.

In 412, Richard Haywood was still reading.

"You should sleep," she said.

"I've been sleeping too much." He set the book aside. "Sixty years ago tonight, I was on a ship in the Pacific. Nobody slept then either. We all stayed up on deck, watching the stars, trying not to think about being far from home."

"Navy?"

"Merchant marine. I wasn't a soldier. Just someone who kept the ships running."

She adjusted his blanket, checked his ankles for edema changes. Slightly better. Good.

"Do you have people coming tomorrow?" she asked.

"My son's flying in. Weather permitting." He glanced at the window. Still no snow. "We're not close. Haven't been for years. But he's coming."

"That's good."

"Is it?" The question was genuine, not bitter. "I signed the DNR today. Decided it was time to stop fighting. And now he's coming to say goodbye to someone he barely talks to. I'm not sure that's fair to either of us."

Theresa had heard variations of this a thousand times. The family dynamics that only surfaced when mortality became real. The regrets that couldn't be revised.

"Maybe it's a chance for something different," she said.

He considered this. "Maybe. Or maybe we'll just be uncomfortable together until it's over. That's most of what we've done for the last twenty years."

She didn't have an answer for that. She finished her checks and moved to the door.

"Theresa."

She turned.

"What made you take this shift? Working Christmas Eve."

It was a question she'd been asked before, usually with an assumption attached — that she was single, or lonely, or avoiding something. Sometimes those assumptions were right.

"Someone has to," she said. "And I don't mind the quiet."

"The quiet," he repeated. "Yes. I understand that."

At 2:30, the snow finally came.

She saw it from the station, fat flakes drifting past the window, catching the light from the parking lot below. There was something almost apologetic about it — late and uncertain, as if winter wasn't sure of its welcome.

Mr. Kowalczyk woke up and asked for water. Mrs. Patterson's vitals were stable; her daughter was awake, scrolling her phone in the dark.

In 412, Richard was asleep for the first time since she'd arrived. The book was still open across his chest, rising and falling with each breath. She removed his reading glasses, set them on the side table, and pulled the blanket up to his shoulders.

The snow was thicker now. She stood at his window and watched it fall.

---

At 5:45, the night finally started to end. The corridor lights brightened incrementally, the way they always did before shift change. Somewhere, a cart rattled. Voices began to carry from the nursing station.

Mrs. Patterson's daughter had fallen asleep again. Mr. Kowalczyk was complaining about the breakfast options.

Richard Haywood was awake, sitting up, looking at the snow-covered parking lot.

"It did come," he said when she entered. "Just like the television said."

"Looks like two or three inches."

"Enough to matter." He shifted slightly, and she could hear the fluid in his lungs, the wet sound of breathing against resistance. He'd be going to dialysis soon if the diuretics didn't work better. Or not going anywhere, if the DNR held.

"Your son's flight — will the snow affect it?"

"Probably delayed. Most things are, with him." But he said it without rancor. Just fact.

She finished her final checks, wrote her notes, prepared for report. Carla's replacement would be someone younger, newer to the floor. Theresa would have to be thorough.

At the door, she paused.

"Merry Christmas, Mr. Haywood."

He looked at her — really looked, the way people do when they're not sure they'll see you again.

"Merry Christmas, Theresa. Thank you for the overnight."

---

She drove home through the snow, the streets empty, the world white and silent. The radio played carols she wasn't listening to. At a red light, she watched a father and his young daughter walking on the sidewalk, bundled in coats, the girl catching snowflakes on her tongue.

Twelve hours from now, she'd do it again. New Year's Eve. Another overnight.

She parked in front of her apartment, killed the engine, and sat for a moment. The snow was still falling. Somewhere in the building, someone had put lights in their window — red and green, blinking in a pattern that was slightly too fast.

Mrs. Patterson might not make it to New Year's. Richard Haywood probably wouldn't make it to spring. Mr. Kowalczyk would go home, and she'd never see him again.

These were the terms. She'd accepted them years ago, somewhere between her first code blue and her hundredth discharge. You cared, but you didn't hold on. You showed up, but you left. You carried people through the night and then handed them to someone else.

She got out of the car. The snow crunched under her feet.

Inside, her apartment was cold; she'd turned the heat down before leaving. A single light was on over the stove, the one she always left burning. There was nothing waiting for her — no tree, no presents, no one sleeping in the other room.

But there was tea. And there was the book she'd been reading, a paperback with a creased spine. And there was the window that faced east, where in an hour the sun would come up on Christmas morning.

She put the kettle on.

Outside, the snow kept falling.
