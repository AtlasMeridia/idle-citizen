# The Night Clerk

The lobby of the Harcourt Hotel has marble floors that echo. Elena learned this her first week: every footstep, every rolling suitcase, every dropped key bounces off the walls and returns multiplied. By her third month she'd stopped hearing it, the way people who live near train tracks stop hearing trains.

Tonight is December 24th. The marble sounds different when the lobby is empty.

She's been on since eleven. The day shift clerk—Marcus, young, talks too much—had lingered at handoff, telling her about his girlfriend's family, the casserole he was supposed to bring, how he'd almost forgotten to pick up the rolls. She'd nodded until he left.

The computer screen glows blue-white. There are seventeen occupied rooms. Most are what she thinks of as Stranded Travelers—delayed flights, missed connections, people who should be somewhere else. A few are what she calls Deliberate Exiles: people who booked this room to have somewhere that wasn't where they were expected.

Elena has worked night shift for four years. She knows the types. She doesn't judge them. She is, after all, one of them.

The elevator dings. A woman in her fifties emerges, wrapped in the hotel robe, bare feet on marble. She walks to the front desk as if this were the most natural thing in the world.

"Is the coffee still hot?"

Elena looks at the station against the far wall. "I can make fresh."

"Don't trouble yourself." The woman pours from the carafe, tests the temperature, shrugs, adds cream. She leans against the counter facing Elena. "I couldn't sleep."

"It happens."

"My daughter's in 412. She's sleeping fine. Has been since eight." The woman sips her coffee. "I should have made her come down for dinner, but she wanted room service. A fourteen-year-old eating pasta alone in a hotel room on Christmas Eve. How did I get here?"

Elena has heard versions of this question hundreds of times. People tell night clerks things they wouldn't tell therapists. Something about the hour, the empty lobby, the transaction—she is paid to be there, awake, listening. It creates a strange permission.

"Where were you headed?" Elena asks.

"Philadelphia. My sister's. The flight canceled at three. Everything canceled, apparently. Snow in Chicago, no planes coming through." She laughs without humor. "We could have driven. Eleven hours. I didn't think of it until we were already checked in, and by then Sarah was in her room with her laptop, and I thought—" She stops. "I thought, maybe this is fine."

"Maybe it is."

The woman studies her. "You're working tonight."

"Someone has to."

"Do you have family?"

Elena's mother is in a memory care facility in Tucson. Her brother lives in Portland with a wife who doesn't like her. Her ex-husband is on his third marriage, happier now, and she genuinely wishes him well. These are facts, not complaints.

"They're scattered," she says.

"But you'd rather be here than with them."

This is not exactly true and not exactly false. What Elena would rather is complicated. She'd rather not have to choose. She'd rather time worked differently, so that she could sit with her mother and have her mother know her, and also be here in this quiet lobby where no one expects her to perform anything. She'd rather her brother's wife didn't watch her with that expression. She'd rather the holidays weren't built around assumptions about what families should be.

"I like the quiet," she says.

The woman nods slowly. "I used to, too. Before Sarah. Then for years the quiet was the enemy—you know? Silence meant something was wrong. Either she'd stopped breathing in her crib or she was doing something she shouldn't be. Fourteen years of high alert." She looks toward the elevator. "Now she doesn't need me to check on her. She locks herself in hotel rooms and talks to her friends online and I'm out here, drinking cold coffee, missing the silence I used to hate."

The lobby clock reads 2:47. Outside, snow has started, thick and silent, swallowing the streetlights.

"There's a family checking in at four," Elena says. "Their flight made it. Grandparents, parents, three kids. They've been driving from the airport for two hours."

"At four in the morning?"

"The kids will be overtired and crying. The grandparents will be irritable. The parents will be snapping at each other. The youngest will probably need the bathroom right when they get here, and someone will have forgotten something in the rental car."

The woman is almost smiling. "You're cheering me up by telling me other people have it worse?"

"I'm telling you that by seven this lobby will be chaos. Right now it's quiet. In 412 your daughter is asleep and safe. You're warm and dry." Elena pauses. "Maybe the holidays are about contrast. You can't appreciate the quiet without the noise coming."

"That's philosophical for three in the morning."

"Night shift."

The woman finishes her coffee, sets down the cup. "I should try to sleep."

"The pool opens at six, if you're still awake. No one uses it early."

"I might." She ties her robe tighter. "Thank you—" She glances at Elena's name tag. "Elena. For the company."

"Any time."

After the elevator doors close, Elena opens the desk's mini fridge and takes out her Tupperware: rice, vegetables, chicken. She eats at the desk, watching the snow fall. Seventeen rooms of sleeping strangers, and her, the only one awake.

Her phone buzzes. A text from her brother: *Merry Christmas. Thinking of you.*

She types back: *Same to you and Amy.* Thinks about adding more, something warmer, but nothing comes. She sends it.

The family from the airport arrives at 4:23. The toddler is screaming. The grandfather immediately needs the restroom and asks where it is with an edge of panic. The mother looks at Elena with the expression of someone who has been awake for twenty hours and sees in Elena's calm face a kind of accusation.

Elena smiles the professional smile. "Welcome to the Harcourt. Let me get you checked in quickly."

By the time they're up the elevator, the toddler's cries echoing down the hallway, the lobby is silent again. Elena clears their paperwork, returns to her Tupperware. The rice is cold now.

Her shift ends at seven. Marcus comes in early, excited about presents, his girlfriend, the rolls that were apparently a big hit. She hands off the desk, collects her bag, walks out into a city covered in white.

The buses are running on holiday schedule, every forty minutes. She waits in the shelter, watching the snow. A man in his sixties sits at the far end of the bench, a paper cup of coffee steaming in his hands. They don't speak.

The bus comes. She gets on, finds a seat near the back. The city passes in white silence.

When she reaches her apartment, she makes tea and sits by the window. The building is quiet—most people away or sleeping. Below, a dog walker trudges through the drifts, pulled by a retriever who doesn't seem to notice the cold.

Elena watches until they're out of sight, then closes her eyes. The radiator ticks. Somewhere in the building a child laughs, muffled by walls.

She doesn't hate this. She doesn't love it either. It's a life, hers, and she lives it.

When she opens her eyes again the light has shifted. Morning fully here, weak winter sun through the clouds. She puts down her tea, goes to her laptop, opens the browser.

The memory care facility in Tucson has a webcam in the common room. It's a small kindness, something for families who can't visit. Elena types in the password, waits for the page to load.

There's her mother, in a chair by the window, face turned toward the Arizona sun. Hands resting in her lap. Still. Elena watches for a long moment, looking for something—recognition, connection, evidence—but there's nothing to see. Just an old woman in a window. Peaceful or empty, impossible to tell from here.

She keeps watching anyway.
