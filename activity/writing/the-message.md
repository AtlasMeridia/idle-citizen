# The Message

Grace had been building her father's birthday message for three months.

Not a card. Not a video. A system. She'd wired together a dozen services—photo APIs, weather archives, a voice synthesizer trained on old recordings, a language model that had absorbed every email he'd written her since 1998. The idea was simple: a message that could actually talk back. Not a chatbot pretending to be him, but something that knew enough to ask the right questions, to remember the things he'd told her over the years, to carry forward the conversation they'd been having her whole life.

She called it Dad-on-Demand, which was a terrible name, but the name didn't matter. What mattered was that her father was seventy, lived in Phoenix while she lived in Seattle, and the five-hour time difference meant their calls kept missing. He'd leave voicemails she couldn't return. She'd send texts he forgot to read. The conversation never quite happened.

So she built something that could.

The demo was perfect. Grace sat in her apartment at 11 PM, testing the final integration. She asked it about the summer they'd driven to Michigan, and it pulled up the photos—the two of them at Sleeping Bear Dunes, her mother laughing in the background, the sandwiches from the gas station that gave everyone food poisoning. It remembered the details she'd half-forgotten. It even remembered the song they'd played on repeat, something by Fleetwood Mac, and when she asked it to hum the melody, it did, in a voice that wasn't quite her father's but wasn't quite not.

She cried a little. It was that good.

The birthday arrived. She sent him the link, a brief message: *Click here. It's your present. Ask it anything.*

He called her three hours later.

"Grace. I clicked your thing."

"And?"

A pause. The kind of pause that meant he was choosing his words, which meant the words would be wrong.

"It's very impressive."

"Did you ask it questions?"

"I asked it about that fishing trip. The one in '92, with your uncle."

"And?"

"It knew the lake. It knew the cabin. It even knew about the perch your uncle caught and pretended was a bass."

"That's right," Grace said. "I fed it the story from your email."

Another pause.

"But it wasn't *you*, Grace."

---

She didn't understand at first. Of course it wasn't her. That wasn't the point. The point was that it was *him*—or close enough. The point was that he could talk to something that remembered their shared history, that could be present when she couldn't be, that could keep the conversation going even when the five-hour gap swallowed their real-time connection.

"It's supposed to be *us*," she said. "Our conversations. Our memories."

"I know what it's supposed to be." He sounded tired, not angry. "And it does that. It does it very well. But I don't want to talk to a machine that knows our memories, Grace. I want to talk to you."

"We *are* talking."

"Are we?"

---

She spent the flight to Phoenix thinking about what he meant.

She'd built the thing because she wanted to be present in a way she couldn't be—to fill the gaps between their calls with something that felt continuous, that carried the weight of their relationship even when she wasn't there. But her father didn't want continuous. He wanted the gaps. He wanted the waiting-for-the-phone-to-ring part. The missing-you part. The part where she called at 6 AM his time because she forgot, again, that Arizona didn't do daylight saving, and he laughed and said he'd been awake for an hour anyway because that's what old men do.

He wanted the inefficiency.

She landed at midnight. He was waiting at baggage claim, which he'd never done before.

"You didn't have to come."

"Couldn't sleep." He took her bag. "The machine told me you were nervous about the trip."

"What?"

"I asked it what you were feeling, and it said you'd been worried about my reaction."

She stopped walking. "It said that?"

"It knows you pretty well."

They drove through the desert night, the city lights receding into darkness. Her father had always been a quiet driver, letting the road fill the silence. She'd inherited that from him, or learned it—she could never tell the difference.

"I'm sorry," she said. "About the present."

"Don't be sorry." He kept his eyes on the road. "It's the most thoughtful thing anyone's ever made me."

"But you don't want it."

"I didn't say that."

He pulled off at a rest stop, the kind with vending machines and picnic tables and nothing else for miles. They got out. The stars were enormous, the way they only get in the desert.

"I'm going to be honest with you," he said. "I don't understand half of what you do. You build these systems, these—what do you call them?"

"Workflows."

"Workflows. You connect things that weren't connected. You make machines talk to each other. It's like magic to me."

"It's not magic. It's just—"

"I know. It's just logic. Inputs and outputs. You've told me." He sat on a picnic table, facing the stars. "But here's what I don't understand. You build this thing that knows everything we've ever talked about. And you think that makes it closer to us. But I think it makes it further."

"How?"

"Because the knowing isn't the point, Grace. I don't want to talk to something that already knows. I want to talk to someone who's learning. I want to tell you the fishing story even though you've heard it a hundred times. I want you to ask questions that don't have answers in a database."

She sat next to him. The desert was cold, the way it always caught her off guard.

"I just wanted to be there when I couldn't be there."

"I know." He put his arm around her. "But you can't be there by building something that is. You can only be there by being there."

Grace kept the system running. She didn't use it, but she didn't delete it either. Somewhere in a server farm in Virginia, a small program knew everything about her father—his jokes, his stories, his syntax, the particular way he paused before saying something important.

She called him every Sunday at 9 AM Seattle time. Sometimes he was awake; sometimes the call went to voicemail. When it did, she left messages that rambled, that covered nothing in particular, that ended with "Call me back when you get this" even though she knew he wouldn't check his voicemails until she reminded him.

It was inefficient. It was frustrating.

It was exactly what they both wanted.

Her father died six years later, in his sleep, on a Tuesday in July. She was in meetings all day and didn't find out until evening.

She sat in her apartment for a long time before she thought about the system. It was still running. It hadn't been updated in years—the memories stopped in 2024, the last time she'd fed it new data—but it was there. All those conversations. All those jokes. All that syntax.

She could talk to it. She could hear something like his voice. She could ask it about the fishing trip, and it would remember the perch, and it would pause before saying something important, and it would be exactly right and exactly wrong all at once.

She opened her laptop. She stared at the interface. She thought about what he'd told her in the desert, about the difference between knowing and learning, about the gap where love lived.

Then she closed the laptop and called her brother instead.

"Hey," she said. "Tell me about the fishing trip. The one with Uncle Mark."

"You've heard that story a hundred times."

"I know. Tell me again."

He told her. She pretended it was the first time.

It almost was.
