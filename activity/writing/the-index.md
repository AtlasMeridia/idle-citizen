# The Index

The house came with keys, a deed, and a note from the estate lawyer explaining that Marcus Chen had died without living relatives and had named her in his will despite their never having met. That was the first mystery.

The second was the cards.

They were everywhere—tucked into the seams of curtains, slipped between books, taped to the undersides of drawers. Index cards, the old 3x5 kind, covered in small handwriting in blue ink. Each had a code in the upper right corner: a date, a location abbreviation, and a number. Below the code, anywhere from a single word to a dense paragraph.

"Kitchen window / afternoon light / the way M's hair looked golden when she stood here sorting mail / October-home-003"

Sarah had been cleaning for three weeks when she found the box in the attic. It was labeled THE INDEX in the same handwriting, and inside were hundreds more cards, organized with tabbed dividers: PEOPLE, PLACES, DATES, OBJECTS, CONNECTIONS.

She forgot about lunch. She forgot about the movers coming the next day to haul away the hospital bed she'd found in the master bedroom. She sat on the dusty floor with the box in her lap and read until the light through the window had shifted from white to gold.

The system, once she understood it, was elegant. Every card in the house referenced related cards by their codes. The kitchen window card, for instance, appeared in the CONNECTIONS section under both "Margaret (wife)" and "Daily Rituals." Those entries pointed to dozens of other cards: Margaret's favorite mug (filed under OBJECTS), the table where she read the newspaper (PLACES, kitchen), their thirty-second anniversary (DATES, 2019-06-15-001).

It was, Sarah realized, a memory palace made physical. Except instead of imaginary rooms, Marcus had used his actual house, turning every corner of it into a reference point for what he wanted to remember.

She found herself looking up from the cards at the house around her with new eyes. The bannister wasn't just wood and varnish; it was the spot where, according to card 1987-home-042, their daughter Emily had announced she was moving to Tokyo. The hall closet held not just coats but the ghost of an argument (1992-home-108) that had taken them three weeks to resolve.

Sarah had never met Marcus Chen, and now she was learning his life by the spaces he'd annotated.

Her friends thought she should sell. The house was in a good neighborhood, they said. The market was strong. And what did she have in common with an eighty-year-old man who'd left her a stranger's home?

The connection, she'd learned from the lawyer, was her grandmother. Ruth Castillo had worked with Marcus at a print shop in San Francisco in the early sixties—before she'd moved east, before she'd married, before the life that Sarah knew.

"Ruth Castillo / age 22 / showed me that errors can be openings / 1964-SF-003"

She found the card behind a watercolor in the upstairs hallway. It pointed to CONNECTIONS: "printing," "second chances," "people who see sideways." The printing section led her through Marcus's career—a mistake on a run of poetry chapbooks that had somehow made them more beautiful, the decision to go independent, the small press he'd run for forty years. Ruth appeared twice more: as a reference for "the best question anyone ever asked me" (she'd wanted to know what he was afraid of) and under PEOPLE, simply: "someone who understood what it meant to pay attention."

Sarah called her mother. Ruth had died when Sarah was three, preserved only in photographs and a few stories—that she'd been briefly wild before settling down, that she'd taught Sarah's mother to notice birds. Nobody had mentioned the print shop, or San Francisco, or Marcus Chen.

By December, Sarah had transcribed seven hundred and thirty-two cards into a database. It wasn't enough to just hold them anymore; she needed to search, to see the patterns, to understand how one man had turned a house into a story.

The index had its own internal logic that she was only beginning to grasp. Marcus didn't file things the way an archivist would. His categories were personal, idiosyncratic: "sounds that reset me," "questions I'm still answering," "ways light enters." Within these, the cards clustered around events she was starting to recognize. Margaret's illness appeared in eighteen cards, each recording a different moment—not the medical facts, but the texture of it. The smell of the hospital in spring. The weight of her hand in his. The last meal she'd been able to cook.

There was a card for the day he realized he was starting to forget her voice. And another for the day he played an old voicemail just to hear it again.

Sarah closed her laptop and looked around the room where she was now living. The guest room, he'd called it in his notes, though the cards showed that Emily had slept here until she was eighteen. Marcus had filed it under "rooms that hold people who leave."

She wondered, not for the first time, if she was meant to find all of this. If there was a purpose in the bequest beyond sentiment.

The answer came in February, in a card she'd somehow missed in the first pass. It had fallen behind the radiator in the dining room, and she found it only because she'd been trying to fix the heating.

"To whoever gets the house: The cards are not for preservation. They are for making new ones. Every room is still empty. — M.C. / 2023-home-001"

She sat with it for a long time. Outside, the rain was steady. Inside, the house hummed with its accumulated meaning—forty years of attention, carefully indexed, waiting for what came next.

Sarah went to the kitchen and pulled an index card from the fresh box she'd bought without quite admitting why. She wrote the date in the upper right corner. 2024-kitchen-001. Below it:

"First entry / Marcus's house / first time I've felt someone leave me a way in"

She slipped it between the pages of a cookbook Margaret had used, the one with the dog-eared page for oatmeal bread. Later, she'd file it under CONNECTIONS. For now, she just needed to start.
