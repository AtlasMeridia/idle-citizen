# The Collection

The vinyl was Robert's, of course. Three hundred and forty-seven records accumulated over twenty-six years, meticulously alphabetized, inner sleeves replaced annually. Maya had contributed maybe thirty—jazz vocals from college, Brazilian imports from São Paulo. But she'd never minded the imbalance. The collection was his thing. Hers was the garden, or had been, before her knees started complaining.

Now, eight months after his death, she stood in his study surrounded by cardboard boxes labeled JAZZ A-F and ROCK G-M, trying to decide what to do with three hundred and forty-seven carefully preserved records that she had never learned how to play.

The turntable intimidated her. Robert had shown her a dozen times—the cartridge, the anti-skate dial, something about tracking force that she'd nodded along to without retaining. He'd always just done it. She would curl up on the couch while he performed the ritual: pulling the record from its sleeve, examining it for dust, placing it with the reverence of a jeweler setting a diamond.

"This one," he'd say, lowering the needle. "You can hear him thinking."

She never could. But she'd learned to pretend.

The record store in town had closed six years ago, replaced by a yoga studio that had itself closed during COVID. Now it was a nail salon. But there was a place in the next town over, Spin Doctor's, where a man named Vic bought collections from estates.

"Vic buys anything," Robert's friend Dave had told her at the memorial. "Took my uncle's whole collection, five hundred records, probably worth nothing. But Vic gave him a fair price. Didn't haggle."

Fair. That was what she wanted. Not maximum value—she didn't need the money—but something that felt like respect. Robert's collection going to someone who would listen to it, not just flip it for profit on the internet.

She called ahead. Vic said he could come by Saturday.

On Thursday, she made herself go through the boxes.

The jazz section was overwhelming. Names she recognized from dinner parties, from long drives, from Robert's attempts to educate her: Coltrane, Davis, Rollins. She'd liked some of it. The early stuff, where you could still hear the melody. Once Robert had shown her "Giant Steps" on a diagram, the way the chord changes made a geometric pattern, and she'd felt briefly like she understood. But she'd never felt it the way he did. His whole body would change when he listened—looser, younger, somewhere else entirely.

She set aside a few albums she thought she might keep. Kind of Blue, because everyone kept Kind of Blue, and she did like it. A Getz/Gilberto record with "The Girl from Ipanema" that reminded her of São Paulo. A Sarah Vaughan album she used to cook to.

Three records out of three hundred and forty-seven. It seemed like an insult to his memory, but she couldn't fake enthusiasm she didn't have.

The rock section was easier. Classic rock had been Robert's rebellion, back before they met. Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, the Stones. He'd moved past it by his thirties, come back to it in his fifties when their daughter Emma started a band and needed to understand where guitar solos came from. Maya had tolerated classic rock the way you tolerate a partner's childhood religion—with patient incomprehension.

But then she found The Anthology, still in its shrink wrap. Beatles. She remembered buying it for him, Christmas 1995, a triple album that had just come out. He'd opened it and laughed.

"I have all of this," he'd said, not unkindly. "Everything on here. But this is great packaging."

And he'd put it on the shelf, never opened, for thirty years.

She held it now. The shrink wrap was yellowed at the edges. Her handwriting on the gift tag, faded but still readable: *To R, Love always, M.*

She set it aside. Not to keep. To think about.

Friday night she made herself dinner, a pasta she didn't taste, and sat in the living room that had become too large. The silence had a texture to it now. She'd grown used to it, mostly, except at meals.

The turntable was in the corner, still covered with the dust cloth she'd put on it after the funeral. She didn't know why she'd covered it—nobody was coming to see, and the dust would have been fine. Maybe she'd just needed to mark the end of something.

She walked over and lifted the cloth.

The turntable was exactly as he'd left it. Record on the platter, arm cued up, ready to drop. She looked at the label: Monk's Music, Thelonious Monk. She didn't know this one, or couldn't place it. Robert had been listening to it in his final weeks, she remembered now. Playing it over and over in a way she'd found irritating at the time.

"You've heard this a hundred times," she'd said.

"I keep hearing new things," he'd said. "That's the point."

She had not understood. She still didn't. A song was a song. You heard it or you didn't. What was there to keep finding?

She flipped the switch. The platter began to turn.

---

The needle caught the groove with that soft pop and hiss that always sounded to her like anticipation. Then Monk's piano, dissonant and offbeat, tumbling over itself. She didn't like it. She never had.

But she listened anyway. Stood there in her house that was too big, surrounded by boxes she was about to give away, and let the music fill the space where Robert used to be.

She couldn't hear what he heard. That was the truth. Twenty-six years, and whatever he found in these records remained invisible to her. But she heard *him*, in a way—his presence in the choice of album, in the careful position of the arm, in the way the needle was ready to drop the moment anyone flipped the switch. He'd queued this up for no one, or for her, or just because he wanted to hear it one more time before whatever came next.

The song ended and the needle lifted. Automatic return. He'd explained how it worked, the mechanism that sensed the inner groove and raised the arm. She'd never cared before.

She cared now. She wanted to understand everything about this machine he'd loved, this collection he'd built, this whole domain of his life she'd shared without entering.

Saturday morning, Vic arrived in a van. He was younger than she'd expected, mid-forties, with the careful movements of someone who handles delicate things. He brought his own boxes, a wheeled dolly, a manifest of prices he'd prepared based on her inventory.

"Nice collection," he said, looking around the study. "Curated. Not just accumulated."

"He knew what he was doing."

Vic nodded. He ran through a few boxes, pulled records at random, checked condition. He made notes in a little book. His handwriting was as neat as Robert's.

"I can do twenty-three hundred for everything," he said finally. "That's wholesale. Could price them individually, take a year, maybe double it. But if you want them gone—"

"I want them gone."

He didn't argue or try to negotiate. He started loading boxes onto the dolly.

When he got to the box marked JAZZ M-R, he paused. Held up the Monk record.

"This one's pretty worn," he said. "Don't know if I can resell it."

"It was playing when you came in."

He looked at her. "You want to keep it?"

She didn't, really. She didn't like Monk. She would never learn to like Monk. But there was something in the grooves of that particular record—the wear, the pattern of playing and replaying, all those times Robert had dropped the needle seeking whatever he sought.

"Just that one," she said.

Vic set it aside.

---

After he left, she stood in the empty study. The shelves where the records had lived were bare now, just pale rectangles on wood that had faded around them. Twenty-six years of collecting, gone in an hour.

She picked up the Monk record. Side A, "Well, You Needn't." She'd looked it up. It was a joke—the title. A play on words. She'd never noticed.

She didn't know how to work the turntable, not really. But she'd watched Robert do it a hundred times. She found a cloth, cleaned the record the way she'd seen him do. Set it on the platter. Moved the arm, carefully, trying to remember the anti-skate dial and the tracking force and all the things she'd nodded along to.

The needle caught. That soft pop. And then the music, complicated and strange, filling the room where Robert used to sit.

She still couldn't hear what he heard. But she was listening now, which was more than she'd ever done.

Outside, the garden she'd abandoned was going to seed. The vinyl she'd never cared about was playing to empty shelves. The man who'd made sense of all this was eight months gone, and she was still here, trying to understand.

She sat in his chair. Let the record play.

It was the beginning of something, even if she didn't know what. Twenty-six years together, and only now was she starting to listen.

The record crackled, skipped, found its groove again.

She didn't get up to fix it.
