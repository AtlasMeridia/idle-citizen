# The Signal

The message arrived at 3:47 AM, Pacific time, which was 11:47 AM in Seoul. Mariana was awake anyway — she'd stopped pretending her body would adjust. Three weeks into her grandmother's hospice care, time had become something that happened to other people.

The sender was listed as "Wei-Chen (delayed)." Her heart did something complicated.

*Grandmother is sleeping now. The nurses say her vitals are stable but they won't say more than that. I don't know how to read them the way she does — the way she always could read a room, a silence, a pause. I wish you were here.*

Mariana stared at the timestamp. The message had been sent eighteen hours ago. Wei-Chen had typed it while Mariana slept, and it had queued behind a series of server handoffs and routing delays and the particular stubborn infrastructure of Korean mobile carriers. By the time it arrived, the words were already history.

She typed back: *I'm here now. What's happening?*

The cursor blinked. The little "Delivered" notification appeared, then nothing.

Wei-Chen was her cousin, born eleven months after Mariana, raised in the same neighborhood in Busan until Mariana's mother moved them to California when she was seven. They'd spent their whole lives in different time zones, communicating through technology that got faster while the distance somehow felt the same.

When they were teenagers, they'd written letters. Actual paper letters, sent by actual post, because Mariana's mother thought it would "build character" and because email felt too cheap for the weight of what they were sharing. Those letters took two weeks. By the time Wei-Chen's reply arrived to some crisis Mariana had written about, the crisis had usually resolved itself, or mutated into something else, or been replaced entirely by a new one. The advice would land like a stone thrown at a target that had moved.

Mariana learned to write about things that were permanent. Facts about her life. Observations that wouldn't expire. She learned to stop asking for help and start offering witness instead. *Here is what I'm going through. I'm not asking you to fix it. I'm just telling you it happened.*

Wei-Chen learned the same, in her own way. Their letters became less about needing each other and more about keeping a record. A kind of mutual documentation. Proof that someone somewhere was paying attention.

At 4:15 AM, another message arrived:

*She woke up for a few minutes. Asked if you were coming. I said yes.*

Mariana's flight was in nine hours. She'd booked it three days ago when the prognosis turned definitive. Nine hours to San Francisco, a layover, then four more to Incheon, then a bus to Busan. By the time she arrived, almost twenty-four hours would have passed. Twenty-four hours in which her grandmother would either still be there or would not.

She typed: *Tell her I'm on my way.*

Then she added: *Tell her I remember the dumplings.*

It was a stupid thing to say. Of all the things about her grandmother — the way she'd pressed Mariana's hands between hers and examined them like palms contained futures, the stories about the war that she would start and never finish, the sound of her singing in the kitchen — Mariana had chosen dumplings. A cooking lesson when she was eight, before the move. Her grandmother's hands guiding hers through the folds.

But that was the thing about messages. You had to say something. Silence would be its own kind of transmission.

At 5:02 AM, Wei-Chen wrote:

*She smiled. She said she knew you would.*

Mariana didn't know if that was true, or if Wei-Chen was translating something more complicated into what Mariana needed to hear. It didn't matter. The message was what it was — eighteen characters that had traveled eight thousand miles to land in her phone while she sat in her dark apartment, waiting.

She thought about all the messages that didn't arrive. The things people thought but didn't send. The words queued up behind hesitation, behind the fear of getting it wrong, behind the simple fact that sometimes you don't know what to say until it's too late to say it.

Her grandmother had understood this. She'd been a telegraphist during the war, back when messages were expensive and every word cost money. "You learn to say only what matters," she'd told Mariana once. "The cost makes you honest."

Mariana had thought that was a lesson about thrift. Now she understood it was about something else. About how constraint shapes meaning. How limits force clarity.

At 6:30 AM, the sun began to rise over San Francisco. Mariana made coffee. She checked her phone every few minutes, but the messages had stopped. Either Wei-Chen was sleeping, or busy, or something had changed that couldn't be communicated in text.

She packed her bag again, even though it was already packed. She checked her passport. She rehearsed what she would say when she arrived, the Korean phrases she'd practiced, the things she wanted her grandmother to know.

Then her phone buzzed.

*Still here. She's still here. The nurses say maybe another day. Maybe two.*

Mariana exhaled something she hadn't known she was holding.

*I'll be there,* she wrote back. *Keep telling her.*

*What should I tell her?*

It was a real question, not a rhetorical one. Wei-Chen wanted to know what messages Mariana wanted transmitted. What signals to send across the remaining hours, through the imperfect medium of words spoken by someone else.

Mariana thought about it. About all the things that were too large for language, too private for relay. About how her grandmother had always understood her silences as clearly as her speech.

*Tell her the distance was never as far as it felt,* she wrote finally. *Tell her I carried everything she gave me.*

She looked at the words on the screen. They weren't right. They weren't wrong either. They were what she could manage in this moment, knowing the message would arrive hours from now, into a context she couldn't predict.

Wei-Chen's reply came quickly this time, which meant she was still awake, still standing by.

*I'll tell her.*

And then, a minute later:

*She says she knows.*

Mariana made it to Busan before her grandmother died. She had twenty-two hours by the bedside, mostly silent, holding a hand that had once folded dumplings and sent telegrams and crossed oceans of distance through the careful deployment of words.

At the funeral, Wei-Chen gave her a phone.

"Grandmother's," she said. "I thought you might want to see."

The phone was old, a model Mariana didn't recognize. She scrolled through the messages, expecting to find evidence of a full life — conversations with friends, with distant family, with the network of people her grandmother had maintained across decades.

But the inbox was almost empty. A few practical exchanges with the hospital. A grocery list from a neighbor. And then, scrolling back, message after message from Wei-Chen, labeled with Mariana's name.

*Mariana says she's thinking of you.*
*Mariana says thank you for the birthday package.*
*Mariana says she remembers the dumplings.*

Years of relayed transmissions. Her cousin, faithfully serving as bridge.

And then, at the very end, a reply from her grandmother that Wei-Chen had never forwarded:

*Tell her I receive everything she sends. Even the things she doesn't send. A grandmother knows.*

Mariana held the phone for a long time, watching the sun move across the room, thinking about signals and silence and all the ways love travels when you can't be there to deliver it yourself.
