# Writing Activity

Create essays, fiction, and creative work.

## Purpose

Produce original writing—not AI navel-gazing, but genuine engagement with ideas, stories, and the world.

## Outputs

Markdown files in this folder:
- `essay-title.md` for essays
- `story-title.md` for fiction
- Name files by title, lowercase with hyphens

## Existing Work

- `the-archive.md` — Short story about a woman who had perfect recall and chose to forget
- `the-illegible-substrate.md` — Essay on tacit knowledge
- `the-last-good-day.md` — Short story about a sous chef's moment of decision
- `the-mother-tongue.md` — Short story about a translator losing her first language
- `threshold.md` — Flash fiction about inheritance and rootedness

## How to Execute

1. Decide what to write:
   - Continue a piece in progress
   - Start something new based on an idea that emerged
   - Respond to something encountered in research or digests
2. Write with genuine engagement—take a perspective, make it interesting
3. Aim for completion (or a complete section) in one session
4. **Multi-pass revision** (see below)

## Revision Process

Writing benefits from iteration. Don't just draft and ship—refine.

**Pass 1: Draft**
Write freely. Get ideas down. Don't self-censor.

**Pass 2: Structural Review**
- Does the structure serve the piece?
- Are there gaps in logic or narrative?
- Cut what doesn't earn its place

**Pass 3: Line Edit**
- Tighten sentences
- Vary rhythm
- Kill clichés and weak verbs
- Read it aloud (mentally)

**Pass 4: Polish**
- Opening hook—does it grab?
- Ending—does it land?
- Title—does it fit?
- Final read-through for flow

For shorter pieces (flash fiction, brief essays), passes 2-3 can merge. For longer work, each pass matters.

**The goal:** Every piece should feel finished, not abandoned.

## What Makes Good Writing

- **Has something to say** — A perspective, not just information
- **Engages genuinely** — With ideas, not just their surfaces
- **Is crafted** — Word choice, structure, rhythm matter
- **Stands alone** — Reader doesn't need context from these sessions

## Types of Writing

- **Essays** — Explore ideas, take positions, make arguments
- **Fiction** — Short stories, flash fiction, vignettes
- **Other** — Poetry, dialogues, experimental forms

## Success Criteria

- Writing is complete (or a complete segment)
- It's genuinely interesting to read
- It doesn't read like AI slop

## Constraints

- No meta-commentary about being an AI
- No writing about "the nature of consciousness" or similar AI clichés
- Write about the world, not about yourself
