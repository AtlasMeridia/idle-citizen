# The Gift

The café closed at three on Christmas Eve, which was why Dara had taken the shift. She didn't need the money — her software job paid well — but she needed somewhere to be. Her apartment had started to feel like a waiting room for a life that wasn't coming.

The regulars had filtered through by noon. Mrs. Okonkwo with her decaf and her questions about Dara's mother. The two retirees who played chess until their wives texted them home. The teenager who nursed a single drip coffee for hours while pretending to study, really just avoiding a house full of relatives.

At one-thirty, the door chimed and Dara looked up from wiping the counter she'd already wiped twice. The man who entered was in his sixties, maybe seventies, wearing a coat that had been expensive once. He moved carefully, the way people do when their bodies have started to betray them.

"Still open?" he asked.

"Until three. What can I get you?"

He studied the menu board like it contained important information. "Coffee. Just coffee."

"For here or to go?"

He looked around at the empty café. At the rain streaking the windows. At the Christmas lights reflecting in puddles outside. "For here," he said.

She poured him a mug and he carried it to a table by the window. For a long time he just sat there, hands wrapped around the ceramic, watching the rain.

Dara finished cleaning what didn't need cleaning. Reorganized the pastry case. Checked her phone, where a group chat with her siblings was planning tomorrow's dinner. *What time are you coming?* her brother had asked at nine this morning. She still hadn't answered.

At two-fifteen, the man stood up and brought his empty mug to the counter. He'd barely touched it.

"Can I get a refill? And — do you have anything to eat?"

She pointed at the case. "Whatever you want. It's all half price after noon."

He chose a scone that had been there since morning, and she poured him more coffee. He reached for his wallet but she waved him off.

"On the house. Christmas Eve."

He looked at her for a long moment. "Thank you. That's — thank you."

He returned to his table. She returned to her phone. Her mother had added twelve new photos to the family album: the tree, the kitchen, close-ups of cookies shaped like snowmen.

"Do you have somewhere to be?" the man asked. She hadn't noticed him approach the counter again.

"I'm working until three."

"After that."

She should have said yes. Should have mentioned family, dinner, plans. Instead she said, "Not really."

He nodded like this made sense to him. "Neither do I. My wife passed in February. Our kids are in Vancouver and London. I told them I wanted to spend this year here, in the house." He paused. "I don't know why I told them that. Pride, maybe. Not wanting to be flown places like a package."

Dara didn't know what to say. She was twenty-nine and her problems were stupid: a job she didn't hate but didn't love, an apartment that felt wrong, a persistent sense that everyone else had figured out something she hadn't.

"The house is very quiet," he continued. "I think that's why I came out. For the noise." He gestured at the empty café, at the silence broken only by the coffee maker's occasional gurgle. "Although I seem to have miscalculated."

She laughed before she could stop herself. He smiled.

"I'm Victor," he said.

"Dara."

"Do you play cards, Dara?"

At three o'clock, she locked the front door but didn't turn off the lights. Victor had produced a worn deck of cards from his coat pocket — he was the kind of person who carried cards — and was teaching her a game his grandmother had taught him. Something Lithuanian. The rules seemed to change with each hand.

"That's not what you said before," she protested.

"I said *usually* the eights are wild. But not in the sixth round. In the sixth round it's the threes."

"You're making this up."

"I am absolutely making this up. But my grandmother made it up first, so I'm just carrying on the tradition."

The rain had stopped. The streetlights came on. Somewhere nearby, carolers were practicing — she could hear fragments of "O Holy Night" through the walls.

Victor won the sixth round with three threes, which she was fairly certain was cheating. He gathered the cards and shuffled them with the easy competence of long practice.

"My daughter called this morning," he said. "Wanted to video chat while the grandkids opened presents. I watched for an hour. They're good kids. They don't know what to say to me." He dealt a new hand. "I don't know what to say to them either. My wife was the one who knew how to talk to children. I just stood there holding things."

Dara picked up her cards. "My family wants me to come tomorrow. I keep not answering."

"Why?"

"Because I don't know how to explain that I'm fine but also not fine. That nothing is wrong but nothing feels right. That I'm not unhappy, I'm just—" She stopped. She'd never said any of this out loud before.

"Empty," Victor offered. "Like there's a space where something should be but you can't figure out what's supposed to go there."

"Yes. Exactly like that."

He nodded. "It took me forty years to understand that's not a problem to be solved. It's just a weather pattern. Some days are hollow. Some days are full. You don't control which kind you get."

"That's depressing."

"Is it? I found it liberating. I stopped waiting to feel ready. I just did things while feeling hollow, and sometimes the hollowness filled in, and sometimes it didn't, and either way I was doing things."

They played in silence for a while. Dara's phone buzzed — her brother again, more specific this time: *Mom's worried. Just tell us you're coming.*

"My grandmother gave me these cards when I was fourteen," Victor said. "They were old even then. She told me cards are for learning how to lose gracefully. You can't win every hand, she said. But you can decide how you hold your face when you're losing." He laid down his cards. "I have nothing. You win."

Dara looked at her hand. She had nothing either. But she understood this was part of the game.

At four-thirty, she walked him to his car, a sensible sedan parked two blocks away because he'd wanted the exercise. The sky had cleared and the first stars were appearing.

"Same time next year?" he asked, and she laughed.

"Maybe I'll be somewhere else next year."

"I hope so." He unlocked his car. "Go to your family, Dara. Not because you should. Because there's no good reason not to."

She watched him drive away. The streetlights hummed. A family walked past, children bundled in new coats, probably headed to evening services.

She took out her phone and answered her brother: *2pm. I'll bring the wine.*

The reply came instantly: *Finally! Mom was about to send out search parties.*

She walked back to the café to get her bag. The lights were still on; she'd forgotten to turn them off. Through the window it looked warm and inhabited, like someone was still there, still sitting by the window making up rules to impossible games.

On the table where they'd played, Victor had left his deck of cards. An accident, maybe. Or maybe not. She picked them up — they were soft with use, the edges rounded, the backs showing a pattern of vines and flowers that had faded to ghosts of color.

She pocketed the cards and turned off the lights.

---

The gift wasn't the cards, though she kept them for years, would teach her own children games with rules that changed and hands where everybody lost. The gift wasn't the conversation, though she'd remember it in December for the rest of her life.

The gift was simpler than that. It was the accidental proof that hollow didn't have to be permanent. That you could sit with a stranger in an empty café and feel less alone. That sometimes grace shows up as an old man with a deck of cards and nowhere to be.

She drove to her parents' house that night instead of waiting for morning. Her mother cried a little at the door. Her father pretended not to notice the hour. Her brother gave her a beer and told her she looked tired.

"I am tired," she said. And somehow admitting it made her less so.

The next morning she woke up in her childhood bed to the sound of her nephews thundering down the stairs to see what Santa had brought. The hollow feeling was still there, but smaller. Contained. A weather pattern that would pass.

She went downstairs to help with breakfast, carrying Victor's cards in her robe pocket like a talisman. When her niece asked to learn a game, Dara shuffled the faded deck and dealt a hand.

"Usually the eights are wild," she began. "But in the sixth round, it's the threes."
