The envelope sat on the kitchen table for three days before Marcus opened it.

He knew what was inside. The return address told him everything: the law firm that handled his grandmother's estate, the one that had been sending letters for eighteen months. First the condolences, then the inventory, then the questions about what he wanted done with the house.

He'd ignored those. Let his sister handle it. She was better at that kind of thing—good at endings, at tying up loose ends. Marcus was good at leaving things open, at not quite deciding, at moving to a new city before anything got too settled.

But Elena had called last week. "I can't do this part for you," she said. "Whatever's in that letter, it's for you specifically. Some legal thing. You have to sign."

So here he was, back in his apartment after work on a Thursday, standing in the kitchen with his coat still on, looking at the envelope that had been sitting there since Monday.

He'd walked past it eleven times. Made coffee next to it. Eaten cereal while it watched him from across the table. It had taken on a presence, like a guest who wouldn't leave but also wouldn't speak.

His grandmother had lived in the same house for fifty-two years. The same kitchen table, scarred and ring-stained, where she'd taught him to play cards when he was seven. The same porch where she'd sit in the evenings, watching the fireflies come out, telling him there was no rush, that everything worth doing took its own time.

Marcus had moved fourteen times since college. Different cities, different jobs, different versions of himself, none of which quite fit. Each move felt like escape and each arrival felt like the start of another countdown.

The envelope wouldn't tell him anything he didn't already know. His grandmother had left him something—probably the house, probably with some condition attached. She'd believed in conditions. Nothing for free, everything earned.

What scared him wasn't the responsibility. It was the possibility that this might be the thing that finally pinned him down. A house. Roots. A reason to stay somewhere long enough for the paint to fade.

He picked up the envelope. It was lighter than he'd expected.

The letter inside was one page. Not the house—Elena was handling that. This was something else. His grandmother had left him the kitchen table. Just the table. With a handwritten note that must have been part of her will:

*For Marcus, who needs a place to sit down and think. Keep it or don't. But if you keep it, stay long enough to let it hold you.*

He read it twice. Then he sat down in the chair he'd been standing next to for three days, and for the first time in a long time, he didn't think about where he might go next.
