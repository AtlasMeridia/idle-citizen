# The Return

It took Marcus three years to come back, and now he couldn't remember why he'd left.

Not the story he'd told himself, the one about opportunity and growth and not wanting to stagnate in a town where nothing changed. That story he remembered fine. He meant the real reason, the one beneath the one he'd rehearsed for family dinners and catch-up calls. The real reason had gone fuzzy, like a photograph left in sunlight.

The house looked smaller. Everyone said that about coming home, so he'd expected it, but knowing didn't help. The porch where he and Danny used to sit on summer nights, trading the same six opinions about sports and music and girls who didn't know they existed — it looked like a stage set. Too small to have held those hours.

His mother opened the door before he knocked. She'd been watching from the kitchen window, probably since he pulled onto the street. He tried not to think about how long she'd been watching that window for cars that weren't coming.

"You're thin," she said, which was her way of saying hello.

"You look good," he said, which was true. Older, but the kind of older that came from learning to live alone. She'd stopped dyeing her hair since the funeral. It suited her.

"Danny's upstairs," she said. "He's been up there since yesterday."

"All day?"

"He comes down for coffee. He's working on something."

Danny worked for a company that did something with software, the kind of thing that sounded like it should make sense when he explained it but somehow never did. Marcus was an electrician, the kind of work where either the light came on or it didn't, and he'd stopped trying to understand what Danny did with his days.

He found his brother in their old room, which their mother had turned into a guest room after they moved out, which meant it looked like a hotel that was trying too hard to feel homey. Danny sat at the old desk, laptop open, code scrolling on the screen.

"Hey," Marcus said.

Danny didn't look up. "One second."

The one second stretched into three minutes. Marcus sat on the bed — his old bed, though it didn't feel like his anymore — and waited. This was Danny. You waited or you left, and Marcus had already done enough leaving.

"Okay," Danny said, finally turning. He looked thin too. Everyone looked thin. "When did you get in?"

"Just now."

"Flight was okay?"

"It was fine."

This was how they talked. Fine and okay and just now. Three years of distance hadn't made them better at saying things that mattered, just more careful about avoiding them.

"Mom seems good," Marcus said.

"She's handling it."

Their father had died in September. Heart attack in the garage, working on a car engine that hadn't run since the eighties. Marcus had flown in for the funeral, stayed three days, and left before the house started to feel like a house again instead of a museum of grief.

Now it was Christmas Eve, and he was back because his mother had asked — really asked, not the asking that was just wishful thinking — and because he didn't have a good excuse not to come. His girlfriend, the one he'd moved across the country for, had become his ex-girlfriend in November. His apartment was a studio he could cross in eight steps. His life had contracted to the dimensions of someone who was supposed to be somewhere else.

"I'm working on a project," Danny said, as if Marcus had asked. "A thing that's supposed to help people make decisions."

"Like a calculator?"

"Like a calculator, but for life choices. You input your values, your constraints, your goals, and it models the outcomes of different paths."

"Does it work?"

Danny turned back to the screen. The question hung there, obvious in its implications. Danny had always been the one who stayed — stayed in town, stayed in the house during college, stayed when their father got sick. Stayed when Marcus left. A calculator for life choices should have told Danny to leave years ago, if it worked.

"It's hard to know if it works," Danny said. "You can't run the counterfactual. You make a choice, you live with it, and you never know what the other path would have been. All the model can do is predict. It can't verify."

Marcus understood this better than Danny knew. Every night in his too-small apartment, he ran his own counterfactual: what if he'd stayed? What if he'd been here when their father collapsed? What if he'd been the one who found him, instead of their mother coming home to an ambulance and a husband who'd been dead for three hours?

The model couldn't verify. Neither could the imagination. You just lived with the choice and the not-knowing.

"Mom asked if you'd help with the tree," Danny said. "She can't reach the top without the ladder, and she doesn't like the ladder."

"You couldn't do it?"

"She wants you to do it."

This was the currency of homecoming: the small tasks that weren't about the tasks. Put the star on the tree, carry the boxes from the attic, fix the squeaky hinge that nobody mentioned until you were there to fix it. These were the things that couldn't be done over video calls or in three-day visits. These required presence.

Marcus went downstairs. His mother had the ornaments out, spread across the coffee table in no particular order. She was holding a glass ball painted with a scene he didn't recognize — a house, a tree, a dog that might have been their old dog.

"Danny painted this when he was eight," she said, seeing him look. "You painted one too. The first year we got glass ornaments instead of plastic."

"What happened to mine?"

"It broke. You threw a football in the living room and it fell off the tree."

He didn't remember that. Or rather, he remembered throwing footballs in the living room — they'd done that constantly, him and Danny, competing for who could throw it through the doorway without hitting the frame — but he didn't remember breaking an ornament. The specific incident had merged with all the others.

"The star's in the box on the right," his mother said. "The ladder's in the garage."

The garage still smelled like his father. Motor oil and sawdust and the particular staleness of a space where one person had spent decades doing things that mattered only to him. The car engine was still there, on a workbench covered in tools, frozen mid-surgery. Marcus stared at it for a long time before he found the ladder.

Back in the living room, he climbed up and reached for the top of the tree. It was a fake tree now — they'd switched years ago, after his father developed allergies that turned out to be early symptoms of the heart that would kill him — and the top branch bent under the weight of the star.

"You have to twist it a little to the left," his mother said. "It sits crooked otherwise."

He twisted. The star settled. He climbed down.

"Thank you," his mother said, and he understood that she wasn't talking about the star.

That night, after his mother went to bed and Danny retreated to the guest room to work on his decision calculator, Marcus sat on the porch in the cold. The stars were brighter here than in the city. He'd forgotten that.

He'd also forgotten the silence. Not true silence — there were cars in the distance, dogs barking, the hum of heating systems — but the particular silence of a place where you could hear yourself think. In the city, thinking was something you did between noises. Here it was something that filled the space.

He thought about his father in the garage, working on an engine that would never run, for reasons Marcus had never understood. He thought about Danny building a decision calculator while living the consequences of decisions he couldn't unmake. He thought about his mother, watching the window for cars.

He thought about the ornament he'd broken, the one he didn't remember. Somewhere in his past was a moment of impact, a glass ball shattering, a small piece of art destroyed by carelessness. He couldn't access it. The memory was gone.

What else was gone? What other moments had slipped away while he wasn't paying attention?

He went inside and climbed the stairs. Danny's light was still on.

"Hey," Marcus said, pushing the door open without knocking. "The calculator. Does it account for regret?"

Danny looked up from the screen. "What do you mean?"

"Like, if you know you'll regret something, does that change the optimal path? Or does the model assume you make choices and live with them?"

"It weights outcomes by emotional impact. Regret is a negative outcome, so choices that lead to regret get penalized."

"But you can't know you'll regret something until you've already done it."

"That's why it's a prediction, not a guarantee."

Marcus sat on the bed again. The same bed, the same position, but something had shifted. He was asking now instead of waiting.

"Does it account for this? For coming home?"

Danny closed the laptop. For the first time all day, he looked at Marcus the way he used to, before three years and a funeral and all the distance they'd accumulated. "The model can't account for everything. Some things you just have to do."

"I should have come back sooner."

"Yeah."

"I'm sorry I wasn't here."

"I know."

It wasn't forgiveness. It wasn't absolution. It was just acknowledgment: you weren't here, and now you are. The model couldn't run the counterfactual. All you could do was be present for the choices that remained.

"Mom's planning a big breakfast," Danny said. "She bought the fancy bacon."

"The thick-cut stuff?"

"She was up at five making lists."

Marcus laughed. It surprised him, the sound of it. "She always made lists."

"She still does. She just runs out of things to put on them."

They sat in the quiet for a while, two brothers in a room that used to be theirs, in a house that used to hold a family of four. The silence was different now. Not the silence of things unsaid, but of things that didn't need saying.

Marcus would leave again. They both knew that. The city, the work, the apartment that was too small — these were the facts of his life, and they wouldn't change because he spent a holiday in his childhood home. But he would come back. More than once, more than just for funerals and forced occasions. He would come back because the alternative was becoming someone who didn't.

The star on the tree was crooked. He'd twisted it the wrong way, despite his mother's instructions. In the morning, she would notice. She might even fix it.

Or she might leave it crooked, as evidence that he'd been there at all.
