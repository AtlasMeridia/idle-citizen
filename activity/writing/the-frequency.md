# The Frequency

The building's heating system made a sound like distant wind. Anna had been listening to it for forty minutes, sitting in the corner of the coffee shop while her mother talked to a woman Anna didn't recognize. They'd run into her in the parking lot—an old colleague, apparently, from the hospital where her mother had worked before Anna was born.

"—and then he just left, can you believe it?" the woman was saying. "Thirty-two years and not even a proper goodbye."

Anna's mother made appropriate sounds of sympathy. She was good at this, the maintenance of social frequency. Twenty minutes ago she'd been crying in the car, and now she was nodding and asking follow-up questions as if her own husband hadn't died three days prior.

The funeral was tomorrow. They'd come here to finalize the order for pastries—Anna's father had specified, in the notes he'd left, that there should be almond croissants from this particular bakery. He'd also specified that there should be no speeches longer than five minutes, that his college roommate should not be invited under any circumstances, and that the music should be Bach, not Beethoven, because "Beethoven is for people who want to feel things at you."

Anna hadn't known her father was capable of such specificity about his own death. He'd always been vague about everything else—vacation plans, political opinions, what he wanted for dinner. "Whatever you think," he'd say, and Anna had thought it meant he was easygoing. Now she wondered if he'd simply been saving his certainty for the things that mattered.

"Is that your daughter?" the woman asked, noticing Anna for the first time.

"Yes, that's Anna."

"She looks just like you."

Anna smiled politely. She'd heard this her whole life and had never been able to see it. But people said it with such confidence that she'd stopped questioning whether it was true. Maybe resemblance was like one of those magic eye pictures—you either saw it or you didn't, and explaining wouldn't help.

"I should let you go," the woman said, finally. "I know you must have so much to do."

More appropriate sounds. Promises to stay in touch that neither party would keep. Anna watched her mother perform the ritual of departure—the lean-in hug, the hand on the arm, the backward wave as the woman walked to her car.

Then her mother sat down across from Anna and was silent.

"You okay?" Anna asked.

"I have no idea," her mother said. "I think I might be. Does that make me a terrible person?"

"No."

"We were married for thirty-seven years. I should be devastated."

"You were crying in the car."

"I was crying because I couldn't find the insurance paperwork. That's not the same thing."

Anna didn't know what to say to this. Her parents' marriage had always been opaque to her—not unhappy, exactly, but not legible either. They'd seemed to occupy parallel grooves that happened to run close together. She'd never heard them fight, but she'd also rarely heard them laugh.

"Do you want to talk about it?" Anna tried.

"I don't know what 'it' is." Her mother looked out the window. "There's supposed to be a shape to this. Grief has stages, apparently. Someone wrote a book about it."

"I don't think you have to do it in order."

"I don't feel like I'm doing it at all. I feel like I'm hosting a party. Making lists, calling caterers, deciding whether the flowers should be white or cream." She paused. "Did you know he had opinions about Bach versus Beethoven?"

"No."

"Neither did I. We were married for thirty-seven years and I didn't know he had opinions about classical music." She picked up a sugar packet, examined it, set it down. "What else didn't I know?"

Anna thought about the notes her father had left. Two pages, single-spaced, printed out and placed in a folder labeled "In Case Of." He'd included his passwords, his wishes for the funeral, and a list of people who should receive specific items from his belongings. Anna was getting his collection of field guides—birds, trees, mushrooms, wildflowers—despite never having gone hiking with him in her life.

"Maybe that's what thirty-seven years is," Anna said. "Learning what you don't know about someone."

Her mother considered this. "That's either very wise or very sad."

"Probably both."

The heating system shifted from wind to something more like humming. Anna's mother stood up.

"We should go. I need to pick up his good suit from the cleaners."

"I can do that."

"No, I want to. I want to do something practical." She pulled on her coat, a complicated process involving snaps and zippers that Anna had never been able to replicate. "Do you know what I keep thinking about?"

"What?"

"Tuesday nights. He always did the grocery shopping on Tuesday nights. Said it was less crowded." She paused. "I'm going to have to learn when the store is crowded now. I'm going to have to develop opinions about that."

Anna thought about all the invisible negotiations of a long marriage—who gets which side of the bed, who fills the car with gas, who remembers to buy more light bulbs. The accumulated infrastructure of a shared life, built up over decades, now suddenly inadequate. Her mother would have to develop new capacities. She'd have to learn things she'd spent thirty-seven years not needing to know.

"Maybe Wednesday," Anna said.

"What?"

"Maybe Wednesday is less crowded. You could try that."

Her mother smiled—not the social smile she'd given the woman from the parking lot, but something smaller and more private.

"Wednesday," she said. "I'll try Wednesday."

They walked out together. The day was gray but not cold, the kind of winter weather that felt like nothing in particular. Anna's mother got in the car and immediately turned on talk radio, filling the silence before it could settle.

But Anna had heard the frequency underneath—that low hum of recalibration. Not grief exactly, not yet. Just the sound of someone preparing to live differently.

The funeral was tomorrow. The pastries were ordered. The Bach was cued up.

The rest would take longer.
