# The Layover

The airport bar had the particular stillness of a place that exists outside of time. Not empty—there were maybe a dozen other people scattered across the seats, each cocooned in their own waiting—but quiet in a way that acknowledged they were all suspended between places.

Marcus ordered a beer he didn't really want and looked at the departure board. His connecting flight to Denver had been delayed by three hours, then four, now "TBD." Outside the windows, snow fell steadily onto the tarmac, covering the planes in white.

The woman beside him was nursing what looked like her second bourbon. She wore a blazer that suggested she'd started the day with somewhere to be.

"Chicago?" he asked, because asking about destinations felt safer than asking about origins.

"Eventually. You?"

"Denver. Sister's place. Christmas."

She nodded, the way you do when the facts of someone's situation are self-explanatory. He was going home for Christmas. Or going somewhere that counted as home for the purposes of the holiday.

"First Christmas without your dad?" she said.

Marcus looked at her sharply, but she was just watching the snow. "How did you know?"

"You've checked your phone eight times in the last twenty minutes. The way you look at it before you put it away again—like you're expecting someone to call but you're relieved when they don't." She took a sip. "My husband left in March. Different kind of absence, I guess. But I know that look."

"I'm sorry."

"Don't be. I'm the one who asked him to go." She flagged the bartender for another. "It's strange, isn't it? You spend years wanting something to be different, and then it is, and you don't know what to do with yourself."

Marcus thought about his sister's emails. The detailed itineraries. The Pinterest boards of Christmas cookie recipes their mother used to make. She was trying so hard to make everything normal that she'd made it impossible for anything to be.

"My sister wants to do this thing," he said. "She bought those ornaments that you write on—the ones where you're supposed to write down memories and hang them on the tree. So everyone can share their memories of Dad."

The woman raised an eyebrow. "And?"

"And my memories of my dad are complicated. He wasn't a bad person. He just..." Marcus turned his beer glass in his hands. "He had a way of making you feel like you were always disappointing him. Not on purpose. He just had ideas about how things should be, and when they weren't that way, you could see him adjusting his expectations in real time. It was like watching someone decide not to hope for something they'd hoped for."

"So what are you going to write on your ornament?"

"I don't know. Something generic. He loved fishing. He was a good cook."

"Sounds like a eulogy."

"Yeah." Marcus took a long drink. "I guess that's what she wants. A eulogy we can hang on the tree and point to whenever things get too quiet."

The snow was accumulating on the wings of the nearest plane. Somewhere a gate announcement played, but it wasn't theirs.

"My mother-in-law is hosting Christmas this year," the woman said. "First time in fifteen years. She sent a schedule. Breakfast at 8, church at 10, presents at 1, dinner at 5. Like if she times everything precisely enough, no one will notice her son isn't there."

"Will it work?"

"God, no. But I'm going anyway. Because that's the thing about absence—it doesn't actually free you from anything. You still have to show up. You still have to sit in the chair where someone used to sit and eat food that tastes different because the person who used to make it isn't there. The obligation doesn't go anywhere just because the person did."

Marcus watched a luggage cart trundle past on the other side of the glass. "I keep thinking about this one Christmas when I was maybe twelve. I got a camera—one of those point-and-shoot digitals. And I spent the whole day taking pictures of everything. The tree, the food, my grandparents, our dog. And my dad kept saying, 'Put that down, be present, you're going to miss it.' And I was so angry because I wasn't missing anything, I was documenting it. I was making sure we'd have proof that it happened."

"And did you? Have proof?"

"The camera's in a box somewhere at my mom's house. I never looked at the pictures. Because after a while, the day itself felt realer than any photo of it could be. And then after a while longer, even the day didn't feel real anymore. Just something that happened once."

The woman turned to look at him directly. "What do you actually remember? From that day?"

Marcus thought. The question wasn't as simple as it sounded. "The light," he said finally. "It snowed that year too. And in the afternoon the clouds broke and everything got this weird golden quality. My mom was doing dishes and the light hit the window and she stopped washing for a second. Just stood there with her hands in the sink, looking out. And I thought—I didn't think in words exactly, I was twelve—but I thought something like, this is important. This is a picture I don't need a camera for."

The woman smiled. "Write that on your ornament."

"What?"

"The light. Your mom at the window. That's a memory. An actual one. Not a fact about who someone was, but a moment that's still alive inside you. That's what an ornament like that is for—not to prove someone existed, but to remember that you were there together."

Marcus sat with this. Outside, the snow continued its slow accumulation. A gate agent announced that all flights to the Midwest were suspended until further notice. Around them, people began the familiar rituals of calling hotels, rebooking, resigning themselves to plans that wouldn't survive the weather.

"What will you do?" he asked. "If you're stuck here."

"Same thing I was going to do there, I imagine. Sit in a chair where I don't quite belong and eat food that tastes different because the person who should have made it isn't there. At least here I can order room service." She finished her bourbon and set some bills on the bar. "Good luck with your ornament."

"Good luck with your schedule."

She laughed—the first real laugh he'd heard in the airport that night. Then she gathered her bag and headed toward the hotel desk, leaving Marcus alone at the bar with his untouched second beer.

He pulled out his phone. There were three texts from his sister—logistics, contingencies, gentle reassurances that it was okay if he couldn't make it, although the length of her reassurances suggested it wasn't entirely okay. He started to type a response, then stopped.

Instead, he opened his notes app and typed: *The light through the kitchen window. Mom at the sink, just standing there. I was twelve. It was snowing.*

It wasn't much. It wasn't a eulogy or an explanation or even, really, a story. Just a moment, preserved in the only way that mattered—not as proof that something happened, but as evidence that he had been there to see it.

The snow kept falling. The board kept showing TBD. And Marcus sat in the space between where he'd been and where he was going, holding onto something he hadn't known he was carrying.
