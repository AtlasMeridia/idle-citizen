# The Mother Tongue

*Short story — ~1,400 words*

Vera noticed she'd forgotten the word for *kitchen* on a Tuesday in November.

She was writing an email to her sister Katya, back in Odessa, describing her new apartment in Portland. *The kitchen is small but gets good light in the morning*—she'd written that in English first, then moved to translate it, and found a blank where the word should be.

It wasn't that she couldn't remember it. She could feel the shape of the word, its approximate length, the consonant it started with. But when she reached for it, her mind offered only the English—*kitchen, kitchen*—as if that word had grown so thick it blocked the path to the original.

She sat there for a full minute before it came back: *кухня*. Of course. How could she have forgotten *кухня*?

But she had. For a moment, she had.

Vera had been in America for eleven years. She'd arrived at twenty-three, hired by a translation agency in New York that needed Russian speakers for technical manuals. Medical equipment, mostly. She learned the English words for parts of the body she hadn't known existed: *vermiform appendix*, *mesentery*, *phrenic nerve*. Her vocabulary expanded outward while something else, she was beginning to realize, was quietly contracting.

She'd always assumed her Russian would remain fixed, a bedrock beneath the shifting surface of her adopted language. A place to return to. She hadn't considered that bedrock could erode.

The forgetting came in stages. First the technical words—which was fair, she supposed, since she'd learned most of her technical vocabulary in English anyway. Then the uncommon words, the ones she only used with family: her grandmother's term for a certain kind of headache, the regional slang for being overwhelmed. Then, increasingly, ordinary words. *Kitchen*. *Umbrella*. *The feeling you get when you stay up too late and the world goes soft around the edges*—but that one was probably not a real word in any language.

She started keeping a list in the notes app on her phone: Russian words she'd had to work to remember. The list grew longer. She tried not to look at it too often.

Her friend Marcus, a translator from Mandarin, told her this was normal. "First-generation loss," he called it. "Everyone goes through it. Your brain is optimizing. Use it or lose it."

"But I use it," Vera said. "I call my mother every week. I write to Katya."

"In Russian?"

"Yes. Obviously in Russian."

"But you think in English."

She started to protest, then stopped. He was right. Somewhere in the past few years, without deciding to, she'd begun thinking in English. Not always, not completely—but when she was working, when she was busy, when she wasn't paying attention, her inner voice had acquired an American accent.

"It's efficient," Marcus said. "You spend all day in English. It makes sense for your brain to centralize. Consolidate."

"But what happens to the other one? The original?"

Marcus shrugged. "It becomes the second language. Eventually, for some people, it becomes the guest language. Something you visit but don't live in."

The metaphor bothered her. She'd grown up in that language. It wasn't a guest house. It was the house.

Or it had been.

She flew home for her mother's seventieth birthday, the first trip back in three years.

At the airport, she found herself searching for words. Simple words. The customs agent asked her something and she had to ask him to repeat it—not because she hadn't heard but because her brain needed an extra moment to switch tracks. Like muscle memory for a skill she hadn't practiced.

At her mother's apartment—the same apartment Vera had grown up in, same furniture, same tea kettle—she sat in the kitchen (кухня, she reminded herself firmly, *кухня*) and listened to her mother talk. The words washed over her, comprehensible but requiring effort. She had to *work* to understand what had once been automatic.

And then there was her own speech. She heard herself hesitating, reaching for words, occasionally sliding English into her sentences without meaning to. Her mother didn't correct her, which somehow made it worse.

"You sound different," Katya said, later that night. They were on the balcony, watching the city lights.

"My accent?"

"Not just that. Your rhythm. The way you build sentences. It's more... I don't know. More direct. Less circular."

"Is that bad?"

Katya considered. "It's not good or bad. It's just different. You sound like someone translating from another language. Even when you're speaking Russian."

The words landed harder than Katya probably intended. Vera stood on the balcony of her childhood home, in the country of her birth, speaking her first language to her own sister, and she sounded—apparently—like a translator. Like someone for whom the original was no longer native.

On the flight home—and she noticed, with dismay, that she'd thought of Portland as "home"—Vera tried to locate the moment it had changed. Had there been a day when English became her primary language, a threshold she'd crossed without noticing? Or had it happened the way erosion happens, slowly enough that you never see it move?

She couldn't find the moment. There was no moment. There was just the accumulation of days, of reading in English and writing in English and dreaming, eventually, in English. The Russian hadn't been replaced. It had been overwritten, like a palimpsest, the old text fading beneath the new.

And yet the old text was still there. She could still read Chekhov and Bulgakov, still follow the lyrics of songs from her childhood, still argue with her mother about politics. The language hadn't been lost. It had receded. Gone from foreground to background. From the water she swam in to something she had to consciously return to.

Was that a loss? She couldn't decide. Something had been given up. But something had been gained too—the English that was now effortless, the career she'd built, the life she'd made in a place where Russian was just one voice among many.

A few weeks after she got back, Vera started a new practice. Every morning, before she opened her laptop or checked her email, she wrote in Russian. Not translations. Not work. Just whatever came to mind—memories, observations, the weird dreams she'd had, the way the rain sounded different here than it did in Odessa.

It was hard at first. Her sentences came out clumsy, English patterns dressed in Cyrillic. But over time, something loosened. The words came faster. The rhythms felt more natural. The language remembered her even as she was re-remembering it.

She didn't know if she was preserving something or just slowing its decay. Maybe both. The bedrock was still eroding—would always erode, as long as she lived in English—but she could visit it more often. Could tend it. Could keep a piece of it from washing away entirely.

One morning, writing about her mother's kitchen, she realized she no longer had to work to remember *кухня*. The word was there, waiting, as it had always been.

For now.

Katya called on a Sunday, mid-afternoon Portland time.

"I had the strangest dream last night," she said. "I was in America with you, and we were speaking English, but we didn't realize it. We thought we were speaking Russian. And then someone pointed it out and we both felt... I don't know. Ashamed? Sad?"

"It's not a shameful thing," Vera said, though she wasn't sure she believed it.

"I know. But in the dream it felt that way." A pause. "Do you ever dream in Russian?"

Vera thought about it. She couldn't remember her last Russian-language dream.

"Sometimes," she lied.

"Good," Katya said. "That's good."

They talked for another hour, switching languages without noticing, the way they always did. And when Vera hung up, she sat in the quiet apartment listening to the rain, and thought about the word for *rain* in three languages, and wondered if there was a word, in any of them, for what she was feeling.
