# The Translation

Yuki's English was excellent. This was the problem.

She had learned it from textbooks first, then films, then a year in Vancouver that her parents still considered the defining experience of her adulthood, though that was fifteen years past. Her vocabulary was larger than most native speakers'. She could distinguish between "bemused" and "amused," between "uninterested" and "disinterested." She knew that Americans said "I could care less" when they meant the opposite, and she had learned to smile at this rather than correct it.

What she had never mastered was the space around words. The pause that meant disagreement. The rising tone that turned a statement into a request for validation. The way a question could be an accusation or an invitation, depending on something she could not locate in the sentence itself.

David's Japanese was functional. He had moved to Tokyo for a company transfer three years ago, and his accent was poor but his grammar was accurate. He could order at restaurants, navigate the train system, conduct basic business meetings. He had learned the difference between *tatemae* and *honne*—the public face and the private truth—though he suspected he still couldn't reliably detect which one he was seeing.

They worked in adjacent departments at the same firm. He handled international clients; she managed domestic accounts. They met at the coffee machine, in the elevator, at the monthly all-hands where the CEO spoke in Japanese and David followed along with the transcript on his phone, always a sentence behind.

Their first real conversation happened by accident. A client meeting ran long, the others left, and they found themselves alone in the conference room, gathering papers.

"How was your New Year?" he asked, in English. They had defaulted to it weeks ago, the mutual second language serving as neutral territory.

"It was quiet. I went to Kamakura with my parents."

"The shrine there? I've been meaning to go."

"The beach," she said. "We always go to the beach on the second day."

He waited for her to continue. She didn't. The pause stretched past where he expected it to end.

"That sounds nice," he said, to fill the space.

She nodded and left.

Three weeks later, a project threw them together. His department's international client was acquiring a domestic company in her portfolio. Suddenly there were daily meetings, shared documents, late nights in the same office.

"The acquisition timeline is aggressive," she said during their first project call. Four other people were on the line, but she was addressing him.

"It's tight," he agreed. "But achievable."

"Tight," she repeated. He thought he heard a question in the word, but when he waited for clarification, she moved on.

Later, reviewing the document she'd sent, he found a note buried in the footnotes: *Consider whether timeline allows for adequate due diligence. Client relationship may suffer.* It was phrased as a suggestion, almost an afterthought. He read it three times before he understood it was a warning.

He replied by email: *Good point. Should we flag this in the next meeting?*

Her response came an hour later, four words: *I defer to you.*

He could not tell if she was agreeing, demurring, or expressing a frustration she didn't want to make explicit. He chose to interpret it as agreement and flagged the timeline concern himself, attributing it to "the team." In the meeting, she nodded along with everyone else.

---

The project grew more complex. They began staying late, the two of them in the conference room after the others had gone. He brought coffee; she brought green tea. The cleaning staff knew to work around them.

He discovered she had a dry sense of humor, expressed so subtly he missed it half the time. Once, reviewing a client's demand that was transparently impossible, she said, "Perhaps they believe we have solved the problem of time."

He laughed. "Should I tell them we haven't?"

"You could suggest we are working on it."

Another pause. He was learning to wait through them, though he still didn't know what happened in the silences. She seemed to be considering something, or deciding what not to say, or simply resting.

"My grandmother used to say, 'The mouth is the gate of misfortune,'" she offered eventually. "I think about that sometimes in meetings."

"What does it mean?"

"Speaking carelessly causes trouble. But also—" She paused again. "Also that some things are better left inside."

"How do you know which things?"

She looked at him as though the question itself was foreign. "You feel it."

He did not feel it. He never had. Words, for him, were tools—imprecise but necessary, better than silence. He could speak of almost anything, given enough sentences. Silence was where he lost the thread.

---

The acquisition hit a snag. Not their fault—regulatory issues, a disclosure problem on the target company's side—but the client was unhappy, and unhappiness rolls downhill.

In the meeting where the news came through, David watched Yuki's face. It did not change. Her expression was the same calm competence she always wore. But her pen, which she had been holding loosely, was now gripped tight enough to whiten her knuckles.

Afterward, he found her in the break room. She was standing at the window, looking at nothing.

"That was rough," he said.

She nodded.

"Are you okay?"

The question seemed to require translation. She turned to face him, and for a moment he saw something in her eyes—not quite anger, not quite hurt, something older than both.

"I told you the timeline was aggressive."

"I know. I flagged it."

"You flagged it." Her voice was flat. "After I wrote it in the footnotes."

"I thought—" He stopped. "I thought you wanted me to be the one to say it."

"Why would I want that?"

He had no answer. He had assumed—what? That she was being polite, or deferential, or navigating some office politics he didn't understand. That her indirection was a choice rather than simply how she spoke.

"I'm sorry," he said. "I misread the situation."

She nodded again. The anger, if that's what it was, had already passed. Or withdrawn. He couldn't tell.

"It is difficult," she said, "when the words arrive but the meaning doesn't."

He wanted to ask if she was talking about him or herself or both. But he had learned, finally, that some questions close the doors they're trying to open.

"Yeah," he said. "It is."

---

The project recovered. These things do, mostly. The regulatory issue was resolved, the deal closed, the client eventually thanked them. In the wash of post-project relief, David found himself thinking about the conversation in the break room more than about the deal itself.

He had been wrong. Not about anything specific—the timeline concern was raised, the work got done—but about the shape of the interaction itself. He had treated her words as containers holding meaning, when they were more like windows: what mattered was what you could see through them.

Or maybe that was wrong too. Maybe he was still translating her into his own metaphors.

At the project close-out dinner, they sat next to each other. The sake flowed; formality loosened. Their boss told a story about a deal gone wrong in the nineties, and Yuki laughed—a real laugh, unguarded, the first he had heard from her.

"You look surprised," she said, catching his expression.

"I didn't know you laughed like that."

"Like what?"

"I don't know. Openly."

She considered this. "Only in Japanese," she said. "My English laugh is different."

"You have two laughs?"

"Everyone does. Don't you?"

He thought about it. He did, actually. The laugh he used in meetings—controlled, strategic—and the laugh that escaped him sometimes watching something alone. Two versions, from the same source.

"I never noticed," he said.

"That's because you're inside them." She took a sip of sake. "I am inside mine too. But I can see that the outside is different."

"How?"

"Because people respond differently. They relax more when I laugh in Japanese. They think I am being more—" She searched for the word. "More truthful."

"Are you?"

The question hung. He watched her decide how to answer.

"I don't know," she said. "I think I am always truthful. But which truth reaches them—that is not mine to control."

---

The project ended. They returned to their separate departments, the coffee machine encounters resuming their old rhythm. But something had shifted—not dramatically, but perceptibly. He no longer tried to fill her silences. She no longer expected him to read between lines that weren't there for him.

One afternoon she stopped by his desk, which she had never done before.

"I am going to Kamakura this weekend," she said. "To the beach."

He waited.

"It is cold this time of year. The water is too cold to swim. But it is very quiet."

He was still waiting. The pause extended.

"You could come," she said. "If you wanted."

The invitation was clear. What it meant beyond itself—he didn't know. He might never know. But he had learned, in the last few months, that not knowing was not the same as not understanding. Some things communicate without being decoded.

"I'd like that," he said.

She nodded. "Saturday. Early train. I'll text you the time."

She left. He sat with the silence she had left behind, and found it less empty than he'd expected. It was just a different kind of full.
