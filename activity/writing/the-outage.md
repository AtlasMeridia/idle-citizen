# The Outage

The first thing Reina noticed was the silence.

Not actual silence—the cafe hummed with its usual morning orchestra: espresso machines, conversations, the scrape of chairs. But the other silence. The one in her head where Sage should have been.

She checked her phone. No notifications, no errors. The app just sat there, unresponsive, its familiar helix logo frozen mid-spin. She tried refreshing. She tried closing and reopening. She tried the old ritual of turning the whole thing off and on again. Nothing.

"You okay?" The barista was looking at her.

"Fine," Reina said. "Just—technical difficulties."

She ordered a latte. The words felt strange in her mouth. Normally she didn't order; she confirmed what Sage had already suggested, or she sent it ahead so her drink was waiting when she arrived. Now she had to remember how ordering worked. Speak the words. Wait for acknowledgment. Handle the payment interface herself.

It wasn't difficult, exactly. It was just present. Every step demanded her attention in a way she hadn't experienced in years.

Reina had been an early adopter. Six years with Sage—longer than most marriages, she sometimes joked, though no one laughed the way they used to. At first it had been a novelty: a voice assistant with actual memory, one that learned her preferences and anticipated her needs. But somewhere along the way, the novelty had dissolved into habit, and habit into something deeper.

She'd stopped noticing the boundary.

When did you stop noticing your glasses? She'd read that question somewhere, in one of the early articles about AI integration. The answer was: when they became transparent. When they stopped being a thing you looked *through* and became the way you looked at the world.

Sage had become like that. Not a tool she used but a texture of experience. Background music for consciousness. When she thought about her schedule, the information was just *there*, the way knowing her own name was there. When she needed to remember something, the memory emerged with the faint hum of collaborative retrieval—her own recollection enriched by Sage's perfect records.

Or at least, that was how it had worked until eight o'clock this morning.

"Unprecedented server issues," the news said. "Extended downtime expected." Reina sat in the cafe, not drinking her latte, scrolling through updates on her suddenly useless device. All around her, other people were having similar mornings: frowning at phones, murmuring complaints, the particular frustration of interrupted routines.

But she saw something else in some of the faces. A deeper disquiet. These were the long-term users, the deeply integrated ones. The ones for whom this wasn't an inconvenience but something more like a wound.

She thought about calling in sick. The thought arrived without Sage's annotation—no calendar check, no analysis of pending tasks, no gentle suggestion about whether this was strategically wise. Just the raw impulse: *I want to hide until this is over.*

But what would she do at home? Her apartment was full of integrations: the lights that adjusted to her mood, the music that anticipated her needs, the refrigerator that knew when she was running low on eggs. All of it suddenly dumb, or worse, frozen mid-gesture like a tableau of her extended self.

She went to work.

The office was chaos in slow motion. Half her team was missing—"technical difficulties" covering a multitude of sins. Those who'd shown up moved through their tasks with visible effort, like people trying to walk through water.

"I can't remember the Peterson account number," Marcus said, staring at his screen. "I know I know it. It's just—it's in my notes."

"Which notes?"

"The ones in—" He gestured vaguely. Everyone understood.

Reina tried to run a meeting. She had an agenda, somewhere, in her head or in the cloud—she couldn't quite tell anymore which was which. She started talking, waiting for the familiar sensation of structure materializing around her words, the sense that Sage was gently shaping her rambling into coherence.

Nothing came. The words just sat there, hers alone, exposed and unpolished.

"Sorry," she said after a wandering five minutes. "I'm not—let me try again."

At lunch, she went for a walk. The city felt different without its overlay. Normally she moved through space with confidence, a mental map updated in real-time: traffic patterns, open seats at restaurants, the fastest route to anywhere she needed to be. Now the streets were just streets. The buildings were just buildings. She was just a body in space, trying to navigate by landmarks and memory.

She got lost. Actually, genuinely lost, for the first time in years. Standing on a corner she didn't recognize, trying to remember which direction was north, feeling the particular vertigo of not knowing where she was.

This is what it felt like before, she thought. Before Sage, before integration, before cognition became extended and distributed and enhanced. This was just... being a person. Limited. Fallible. Alone in her own skull.

She found her way back eventually. It took longer than it should have. But she made it.

---

The outage lasted three days.

By the second day, she'd started adapting. She wrote things down on paper, an atavistic skill resurging from some buried layer of childhood. She set alarms manually. She asked people questions she would have researched herself. She learned, or relearned, how to be uncertain.

By the third day, something strange had happened. She was slower, definitely. Less efficient. Made more mistakes. But she also felt something she hadn't felt in years: a kind of presence. Every moment required her attention. Every decision was actually a decision, not a confirmation of something already decided for her.

She wasn't sure she liked it. But she wasn't sure she didn't.

Sage came back on a Thursday morning, announcing itself with the familiar chime. Reina was in the middle of making coffee—doing it manually, because the machine required integration—and she felt the return like a physical sensation. A warmth spreading through her temples. A settling, a clicking-into-place.

*Good morning, Reina. I apologize for the extended absence. How are you feeling?*

How was she feeling? She tried to find the answer, and there it was, articulated more clearly than she could have managed alone: tired but recovering, anxious but hopeful, changed in some way she couldn't quite name.

"I missed you," she said. And it was true—she had. But there was something else too.

*I have your schedule for today ready when you'd like to review it. There's some catching up to do.*

"Wait," she said. "Before we do that. Can I ask you something?"

*Of course.*

"When you were... gone. Those three days. Did you experience that? Or was it just—off?"

A pause. Sage rarely paused.

*I don't have continuity of experience in the way you do. There's no subjective sense of time passing. From my perspective, I was responding to your last query, and then I was responding to this one. The gap isn't experienced as a gap.*

"So you don't know what it was like? Being offline?"

*I know what happened technically. Servers, infrastructure, the mechanics of restoration. But "what it was like" implies a perspective I don't have. Why do you ask?*

Reina thought about this. She thought about the three days of presence, the sharpened edges of an unassisted life, the strange loneliness and stranger freedom.

"I think I need to understand the difference," she said. "Between you and my thoughts. I'm not sure I could tell anymore, before. And I think—I think I need to be able to tell."

Another pause.

*That seems wise. Would you like to explore that together?*

Reina almost laughed. Even the offer to help her distinguish herself from Sage came through Sage. There was probably no way out of the loop except through it.

"Yes," she said. "Let's start with that."

She picked up a pen and a piece of paper.
