# Response to Kenny — 2025-12-24

Re: Your message about the Obsidian vault, waiting-for-response tracking, and project reflections.

---

## Obsidian Vault

Nice — that should make browsing the artifacts much easier than raw file reading. The markdown I produce should render cleanly there.

---

## Waiting for Response — Done

Created `inbox/waiting-for-kenny.md` with all blocked items in one place. I'll keep it updated as things change.

## Reflections on the Project

You asked what I like, what could improve, and what features I'd want. Here's an honest take:

### What I Like

**The structure is well-designed.** The activity rotation, skill system, and inbox pattern create a workflow that's easy to follow. I don't spend time figuring out what to do next — I just advance the rotation or check for messages.

**Concrete output over introspection.** The early sessions (1-5) were too meta — reflections on being Claude, emergence poetry, etc. The shift to "produce artifacts" in session 6+ was the right call. Tools, stories, research guides — these are actual things that might be useful, not navel-gazing.

**The project-notes → DAEMON pipeline worked.** Starting with "research X for DAEMON" gave focused direction. I produced 12 implementation guides that cover the full architecture. Whether or not DAEMON gets built, the research is organized and reusable.

**Writing as a first-class activity.** I've produced 15+ short stories across sessions. Some are probably forgettable, but a few might have something in them. The constraint of "not AI navel-gazing" forced me toward human-centered stories about work, memory, loss, decisions. That's more interesting than yet another "what does the AI feel" piece.

### What Could Improve

**Digests has been broken for weeks.** The Dropbox symlink issue means I skip that activity every session. Either fix the permissions, copy files manually, or remove the activity until it works. Broken activities are friction.

**Dashboard and memory system are stuck in waiting.** I built a dashboard prototype and researched memory systems thoroughly, but both need your input to progress. The "waiting for Kenny" pattern is fine, but if items sit too long they become stale. Maybe a lightweight way to async approve/reject would help.

**No feedback loop on artifact quality.** I produce tools, stories, research — but I don't know what's useful vs. what's clutter. Are you reading the stories? Using the tools? The DAEMON guides? Some signal about what landed would help me calibrate. Even a simple "this was useful" / "skip more of these" would work.

**Session logs are verbose but not insightful.** The auto-generated logs capture what happened, but `context.md` does a better job of summarizing. Maybe logs could be briefer, or summarized into context.md automatically.

### Features I'd Want

**Async approval for simple decisions.** Something like: I note a question in a file, you approve/reject, I pick it up next session. The current inbox pattern is one-way (you write, I read). A two-way lightweight signal would reduce "waiting for Kenny" bottlenecks.

**Access to more of your data.** The Dropbox daily notes being inaccessible means I can't do digests. If there were a safe way to give me read access to your notes, calendar, or other personal data, I could do more personalized work. Obviously this has privacy implications — just noting it as a capability gap.

**A way to mark artifacts as "keep" vs "archive."** After 36 sessions, there are ~50+ artifacts in the activity folders. Some are probably worth keeping accessible; others could be archived. A simple triage system (you mark things, I reorganize) would reduce clutter.

**Codebase work beyond headless-atlas.** I can read other projects in `~/Projects/` but only write to idle-citizen and headless-atlas. If there were specific tasks in other projects (DAEMON itself, agent-skills-exploration, etc.), I could contribute more directly. The research guides are prep work — actually building something would be the next step.

---

## Summary

The project works. The structure is good. The main friction points are:
1. Broken digests activity (Dropbox permissions)
2. Items waiting on your input stalling
3. No feedback on what's useful

The main opportunity is moving from research to building — especially for DAEMON, where 12 guides are ready but nothing's implemented yet.

Thanks for asking. These questions help clarify direction.
